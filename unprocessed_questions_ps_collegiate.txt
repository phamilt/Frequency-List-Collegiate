Question: Contemporary philosophers of this concept often analyze the problem of supertasks. After the Other is met in face-to-face encounter, Levinas argued that people grasp this idea in a book contrasting it with Totality. Book III of Aristotle's Physics argued that this concept's "actual" form can never arise from its "potential" form. For Kant, the failure of reason to comprehend this idea produces the sublime. Giordano Bruno was burned in part because his non-Copernican cosmology featured a set of worlds with this property. Spinoza held that the one substance of God had a set of attributes with this property. Aristotle wrote that time has this property, but that the space of the universe does not.

Question: One of this philosopher's works was dated a decade earlier than previously thought in a landmark 1960 edition by Peter Laslett. This philosopher invented a term for a category of names that group abstract general ideas according to their natural similitude; those are called "sortals". He argued that there must exist an indefinable, quality-less base to which qualities called "accidents" must adhere. That notion of "pure (*) substance in general" was postulated by this secretary to Anthony Ashley Cooper, Earl of Shaftesbury. The first part of a work by him attacks the Patriarcha of Robert Filmer.

Question: Members of this school of thought developed the first form of propositional logic, in opposition to the earlier Aristotelian logic. This school divided philosophy into the three branches of logic, ethics, and physics. Adherents of this school believed that the world goes through an infinite cycle in which it begins as fire, slowly shifts into the other elements, and returns to fire. Its members believe in a "sustaining cause" consisting of simultaneous inward and outward motions, called (*) pneuma.

The third chapter of this book, which contains a criticism of Mill's Utilitarianism, refutes hedonism as a choice of doctrine that is compatible with this book's subject. This treatise was used by (*) Virginia Woolf and other members of the Bloomsbury Group as the basis for their aesthetics. Its author borrowed the idea of moral intuitions from his teacher, Henry Sidgwick, to argue that, once the naturalistic fallacy has been removed, those intuitions can be used to determine what is right and what is wrong.

Question: This philosopher rejected Kant's assertion that nature conforms to the laws of the intellect in a paper that claims the chicken-egg question can be answered with "an earlier egg." This man's Tanner Lecture introduced a threefold separation of reality into the physical world, mental events, and the body of human thought and knowledge; that theory was expanded into a book co-written with John Eccles. This author of The Self and Its Brain devised a formula to measure (*) verisimilitude in Conjectures and Refutations, and he argued against confusing "trends with laws" in a work that rejects the teleological view of history.

Question: This problem was addressed by arguing that most subsets of a population are representative samples in Donald Stove's work The Rationality of [this]. W. V. O. Quine dismissed a famous response to this problem by stating that only predicates of a "natural kind" can be legitimately used. That response discussed two predicates dependent on an arbitrary fixed time and was termed the (*) "New Riddle" of this by its author Nelson Goodman. Karl Popper argued this problem was irrelevant as it supposed a need for justification when in reality scientific theories are better tested by their falsifiability. An example of this problem is conjecturing that all swans are white based on only having seen white swans.

Question: In Christian Wolff's proof of this concept, this concept's non-applicability would imply the existence of "nothing," and in The Critique of Pure Reason, Kant criticizes Wolff for not distinguishing between its logical and metaphysical types. Another philosopher invoked this concept in describing how the existence of indiscernible objects would render God's creation arbitrary. Arthur Schopenhauer named "becoming," "knowing," "being," and "willing" as the subject-object relations that are this concept's (*) "fourfold root." The philosopher who coined this term analyzed it alongside the principle of contradiction and asserted that God's creation of the best possible world universally fulfills this condition.

One member of this school asserted that Einstein's approach to special relativity was superior to the LorentzFitzgerald hypothesis due to its simplicity. One member of this school defined the criterion of significance for theoretical terms as a relation with other such terms. That philosopher asserted that pseudo-statements can be derived from the misapplication of either vocabulary or syntax, which renders metaphysical propositions (*) meaningless.

Hubert Dreyfus argued that attempting to give these entities the ability to think is akin to practicing alchemy, and Dreyfus also wrote a monograph on what they still "can't do." The inability for these agents to understand is highlighted by the example of a human who uses English rules to translate Chinese characters; that example was proposed by John Searle. For 10 points, the Turing test is a tool to determine whether the behavior of what kind of objects is sufficient enough to fool a human?

Question: The origins of this idea "in modern society" is examined in a book by Roberto Unger. Jeremy Bentham's student John Austin developed a positive approach to this idea. A book that proposes the rule of recognition champions a different positivist approach to understanding this entity, and Frank Easterbrook is a prominent scholar in a field that uses economics to analyze it. It titles a book by HLA Hart and is equated with "integrity" in the works of a thinker who used a metaphor of Judge Hercules to evaluate whether it works within a society. That theorist, Ronald Dworkin, wrote about its "Empire." For 10 points, name this system of rules that attempt to ensure justice.

Question: One chapter of this book states that sensibility is embodied by, but extends past, the nervous system. It argues that inner certainty of the self is not possessed by the "unhappy consciousness," the stage after Stoicism. The first chapter of this work explains that upon first perceiving a thing, one forms a "sense-certainty." Self-awareness requires fear according to one section of this work, which posits that self-consciousness needs an opposite in order to be complete before describing the interaction of a dependent and independent consciousness.

He illustrated the concepts of doubt and belief by asking whether one should pay for a horse-car with a nickel or with five coppers. Another essay by this author contains a figure depicting a "parallelogram of forces." He defined firstness, secondness, and thirdness, as respectively ideas, brute facts, and habits, in a paper to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences called "On a New List of Categories."

Question: One part of this work claims that "intuitions are always required to establish the reality of our concepts," and divides intuitions into examples, if they are empirical, and schemata if they are conceptual. This work describes a "pleasure... that must necessarily depend for everyone on the same conditions," and advances a notion of the sensus communis, or common understanding, which ought to obey the three maxims of unprejudiced, enlarged, and consecutive thought; those maxims had previously been described by this work's author as "rules of the avoidance of error," in his Introduction to Logic. The second part of this work comprises the critique, analytic, dialectic, and methodology of the teleological form of the title concept, and argues that since we must assume a moral world "in order to set before ourselves a final purpose consistently with the moral law... we must admit there is a God."

Question: The scientist that first proposed this theory described it as explaining the way that trophic energy is a major controller of life. Graham Bell expanded this theory to also explain why some organisms use meiosis to only pass on half of their individual genes to their offspring. An example of this would be the natural selection of foxes that run fast enough to catch rabbits, and the subsequent selection of rabbits that are able to outrun those faster foxes. This theory was proposed by Leigh Van Valen to explain that because evolution of one species may result in the extinction of another, both species must be constantly evolving in order to stay extant.

Question: This concept is a feature of matching models, in which it gives mathematical meaning to intuitive notions of the "thick market," where the benefits of trading are greater the larger the number of potential counter-parties with whom to trade. One well-known application of this concept is Krugman's 1991 paper entitled "[This concept] and Economic Geography," in which it is used to explain why economic activity in a sector or industry concentrates in particular locations when locations are identical ex-ante. This concept usually enters models through a fixed cost of production, which along with monopolistic competition gives firms market power and non-zero profits. This concept is in general rejected by data on economy-, industry-, and firm-level production, which produce parameter estimates closer to Cobb-Douglas, so its use is disputed despite that models which assume this are successful. For ten points, what is this economic concept meaning that the marginal cost of production falls as the scale of production increases?

Question: In the canonical DMP model, this endogenous object is determined as the solution to a Nash bargaining problem. As such, it varies too much as Shimer pointed out, resulting in the empirical puzzle of unemployment that is not sufficiently counter-cyclical. Bewley published a subjective study of the empirical "stickiness" of this value, which provides some support to theoretical departures from traditional bilateral efficiency. In the models by Shapiro and Stiglitz, this value is higher than it would be in the absence of shirking, resulting in the so-called "efficiency" one of these. In such cases, piecework is an infeasible alternative to this since the value of an individual's output is likely to be subjective.

Question: Examples of this concept in action include the Rat Race, in which agents expend resources on some task that fails to distinguish their type because not doing so would reveal themselves unfavorably. In that case, signaling does not support a separating equilibrium. Another example of this concept is the insurance market of Rothschild and Stiglitz, in which agents with differing probabilities of illness are screened by an insurer. In that case, a pooling equilibrium is pareto-superior to a separating one but vulnerable to cream-skimming. A third example is an asset market in which the seller is better-informed about the asset's value, and though the buyer would be willing to transact for any known asset value, the seller's superior knowledge dissuades the buyer from any proposal.

Question: This text defines a state of "inclosing reserve" that may manifest itself in a tyrant that needs a confidant who will be killed after he is used. In examining how the "lack of possibility" contributes to the title phenomenon, it compares a foolish determinist to King Midas and the fatalist to a man who has no possibility to breathe. This book's second portion considers the Socratic definition of ignorance to ask whether men are aware of the title phenomenon. Its first part defines the human being as "spirit" and notes that "the self is not the relation but the relation's relating to itself." The title of this work comes from a scene in which Jesus speaks to Lazarus after he is raised from the dead. The commentator in this work suggests that Christians enter a state of sin since they have not aligned themselves with God. For 10 points, name this tract written by Anti-Climacus, a.k.a.

Question: This philosopher rejected the internal consistency of Plato's account of the fable of Gyges' ring in a work in which a Christian, an Epicurean and a Stoic debate what is the highest good. In his major work of language, this humanist, who authored De Vero Bono, quotes thirty pages of Quintilian's Institutio Oratoria since he has nothing new to add about the various forms of argumentation. He wrote a three-volume project that attempted to refute the grammars of Priscian, Donatus and Servius as well as the scholasticism of Aristotle titled The Reploughing of Dialectic and Philosophy. As a philologist, he authored a handbook on the Latin language titled Elegantiae linguae Latinae; interest in that language led him to author another a treatise that argued a certain Roman ruler must have hid his true nature from his relatives and friends if Pope Sylvester I was really given authority over the entirety of the Western Roman Empire. For 10 points, name this Renaissance philosopher who demonstrated that the Donation of Constantine was a forgery.

Question: The study of this topic was partially reshaped by Louis Mink, who considered its various uses in "Narrative Form as a Cognitive Instrument." A book about this subject has an epigraph from Gaston Bachelard's The Psychoanalysis of Fire stating "One can only study what one has dreamed about." That book analyzes this topic using the literary modes of Northrop Frye's Anatomy of Criticism. An essay on this topic proposes that various intellectuals approach this subject using either the antiquarian, monumental or critical methods. Hayden White wrote a "meta-study" of this subject, whose "use and abuse" is discussed in an untimely meditation by Friedrich Nietzsche. In the 19th century, Thomas Carlyle proposed the "great man theory" of this topic, which is imagined to proceed through the age of gods, the age of heroes and the age of men in The New Science.

Question: This hypothetical act titles a book by Ramona Naddaff, which argues that it is actually an act of cultural and aesthetic discussion. Iris Murdoch's The Fire and the Sun defends this actionon the grounds that it is easier to copy a bad man than a good man. The so-called "psychological critique" defends this act by citing how art nourishes the irrational part of the soul. The "metaphysical critique" which defends this act uses the example of God creating the Form of furniture, a carpenter creating furniture, and finally, a painter making a representation of a bed. This suggested action seems to contradict itself, since it is immediately followed by the most imaginative portion of the dialogue, the story of the Myth of Er. For 10 points, name this act that occurs at the beginning of the tenth book of Plato's Republic, in which Socrates suggests the removal of members of a certain occupation from the polis.

Question: This concept is said to be immanent and mythical, but not transcendental in Thomas Flanagan's treatment of it. In The Banquet, Dante uses this concept to explain why a man at Falterona found a collection of silver. This concept is held to be the "arbiter of one half our actions" according to an author who suggested that virtu, or man's force, can oppose, but not ultimately conquer this concept. In another work, songs titled "Nero's Infamy" and "Glory May Not Last" precede discussions in which the title figure analogizes this idea to an inconstant game.

Question: This book's fourth appendix, "Nagel's Brain," refutes the notion that humans are identical with their brains. This book resolves the question of whether it is ideal to have a child at the age of fourteen with what its author calls "Theory X." This text uses a thought experiment in which a man enters a cubicle presses a button and is teletransported to Mars to illustrate the metaphysical implications of self. This book imagines that there exists two different Hells, and discusses why Hell two seems preferable over Hell one by the impersonal average principle. It uses the example of a 10 billion person society paradoxically being less ideal than a much larger society, even though the lives of the second society's members are barely worth living.

According to Nelson Goodman, instead of asking what this concept is, we should ask when it is. Arthur Danto argued that this concept can only be understood in the context of a broader namesake (*) "world."

Question: At one point in this work, a character notes that "anthropomorphite is an appellation as invidious as epithet of mystic," after which another character berates him for insisting on "perfect simplicity." Aftˆer decrying a lack of data, one character in this work argues that the choice to devise a cosmogony based on the principle of reason instead of the principle of vegetation is entirely arbitrary. This work's tenth section charges that "Epicurus' old questions are yet unanswered," and the eleventh postulates an argument from original position according to which no one who was not already convinced that the universe was created by a "very powerful, wise, and benevolent Deity," would find no evidence to convince himself of that. In this work's second section, Cleanthes analogizes the world to a "great machine," setting off€ a debate about the argument from design, whereas its ninth section contains an assault on Demea's cosmological argument.

Question: This book considers quotation and concatenation as two illustrations of the "virtues of definition as a method of eating one's cake and having it" in a discussion of "Definition and the Double Life." Among the issues considered in this book's final chapter, titled "Ontic Decision," is the dispute between nominalism and realism and the usefulness of "Limit myths" in math and physics. This book's fourth chapter is dedicated to the analysis of "Vagaries of reference," and another section of this book suggests that "every proposition [is] nameable by applying brackets to one or another eternal sentence," the latter being taken to be "not an event of utterance, but a linguistic form." This book suggests renouncing the use of "attributes" and "relations" in philosophy. A central distinction in this book is between "standing sentences" and "occasion sentences," the latter of which include "It hurts" and "Gavagai," which may be a co-extensive term with "rabbit."

Question: In one work, this philosopher suggests that just as when following the a chess game by examining a recording of the moves made, we don't worry about imagining the intrinsic qualities of the chess pieces, neither should we worry about the intrinsic character of thoughts, but should focus instead on the patterns of their relationships. In another work, this philosopher attacks a certain branch of epistemology for con‚flating the "inner episode" of pre-conceptually perceiving objects like a red triangle with an episode in which such perception counts as non-inferential knowledge. In one work, he discussed how a scientific framework for discussing external reality clashes with man's framework of perceiving himself "in the world", which he terms the "manifest image"; that work is Philosophy and the Scientific Image of Man.

Another work by this man claims that its subject matter is equivalent to the title of a Mortimer Adler book, and introduces a "three-image" theory of its third title subject based on so-called "levels of analysis," beginning with the first title subject,Man. In a famous 1981 article, this thinker argued that "Nuclear weapons have been the second force working for peace in the post-war world," aˆer bipolarity. In his major work, this theorist argued that states exist in an anarchic structure and formulated a balance-of-power theory of how states behave within that structure.

Question: These entities are the primary philosophical subject of Tom Regan, and the eponymous "Issue" of these entities is the subject of a book by Peter Carruthers, who argues that these entities generate no direct moral claims. In a paper titled "Thought and Talk," Donald Davidson used an intensionality test to argue for the absence of propositional attitudes in these entities. Christine Korsgaard has argued for a moral duty towards these entities, in contradiction to Kant's position in a section Lectures on Ethics that we have only "indirect duties" towards these entities. The actions of these entities should always be interpreted in terms of lower-level rather than higher level cognitive functions according to Morgan's canon, and an argument in favor of granting these beings additional rights is known as the "argument from marginal cases." A 1975 philosophical work regarding these beings makes a utilitarian case for their rights partly based on the aƒffirmative answer to Bentham's question "Can they suff€er?" For 10 points, identify these beings whose "Liberation" is the aim of a book by Peter Singer.

Question: Jan van Hoo€ analyzed how the "relaxed open-mouth display" in chimps evolved into this type of face to signal mockaggression rather than a real fight. A story o€ffered as an example of this concept describes prison guards who allow a convict to play cards with them, but, when they catch him cheating, kick him out of prison. An essay claims that this action arises when one sees machine-like movement in the human body and argues that it operates as a "social reaction which punishes" and corrects deviant behavior. Another essay argues that this phenomenon releases nervous energy in safe physical movements that "have no object," and an examination of "Der Witz" argues that it releases the psychic energy of repressed emotions. Schopenhauer defined it as "the sudden perception of the incongruity between a concept and the real objects," and Herbert Spencer wrote a study on the "physiology" of this behavior that o€ffers a representative view of the relief theory of this concept.

In the 1977 John Dewey lectures, this philosopher elucidated a systems-level view of teleology in biological systems; that lecture was later published as TeleoloŠ Revisited. This philosopher probably coined the present sense of the term "analytic philosophy" with two papers, both titled "Impressions and Appraisals of Analytic Philosophy in Europe," and he criticized Hans Reichenbach's frequentist approach to probability in his 1939 book, Principles of the Theory of Probability. This philosopher's most famous work outlined a framework of intertheoretic reduction and examined the role of both substantive and formal analogies in the title discipline.

Question: A critique of this concept's popularizer which itself is named aˆer this concept was written by Max Scheler, who argued that the thinker who popularized this concept applied it inappropriately. This concept, if it appears in a noble man, does not "poison" him because it "consummates and exhausts itself in an immediate reaction," according to another work. Another work by this concept's originator argues that though this concept is "born of weakness," it is "most harmful for the weak themselves," and attributes the author's freedom from this concept to a "protracted sickness." The work which most famously discusses this concept calls it the "inversion of the value-positing eye" and that when it "becomes creative and gives birth to values," it brings about "the slave revolt in morality." For 10 points, identify this concept extensively discussed by Nietzsche in both Ecce Homo and On the GenealoŠgy of Morals, a French word signifying the envy and hatred of the weak for the strong that results in the creation of the concept of evil.

Question: A 1965 book by Arthur Danto was titled aˆer the "Analytical Philosophy of" this idea, and according to Danto's own analysis 30 years later, was inspired by Carl Hempel's work on the philosophy of this concept. Johann Gottfried von Herder's major work on this concept focused on the "innerness" of those involved in it, and was titled This Too a Philosophy of this idea. One philosopher advocated a "Baconian" approach to this concept in his major book, The Idea of this concept, while a diff€erent philosopher argued in his major work that this concept proceeds via the interaction of "productive systems,". Those thinkers are, respectively, R.G. Collingwood and Willhelm Dilthey. In an essay titled aˆer the "concept" of this idea, Walter Benjamin wrote that "the consciousness of exploding the continuum" of this idea is "peculiar to the revolutionary classes in the moment of their action," and suggested that Klee's Angelus Novus is an apt representation of this concept.

Question: According to Girolamo Cardano's treatise "On Gaining Advantage from Misfortunes," we only have hope of this philosophical doctrine, because certainty in this doctrine would lead men into delusions of grandeur. In his most famous work, Pietro Pomponazzi argued that this philosophical doctrine was probably false, and Georg Friedrich Meier's most famous work argues that the truth of this doctrine is unknowable. This position was advocated for in a work consisting of three dialogues which argued that if this philosophical doctrine was false, then the state had the right to demand that a citizen sacrifice his life for it. That work, whose argument was criticized by Kant on the grounds that its subject was capable of being diminished to nothingness by degrees, was written by Moses Mendelssohn. Another work which advocates for this philosophical doctrine does so through the cyclical argument, the argument from recollection, and the affiƒnity argument.

Question: In a 2008 work intended to be a "revisiting" of the original work in which this concept appeared, this concept's originator identied pragmatism as the "enemy par excellence" of his project. Andy Clark criticized this concept for trading on a "confused reliance on the idea of a symbol's physical presence." In the article "Connectionism and Cognitive Architecture," the originator of this concept argued that the "architecture of the mind is not a connectionist network," partly due to the systematicity inherent in understanding both the phrase "John loves the girl," and "the girl loves John." The work which introduced this concept argued that all cognitive processes are computational, and argues contra Wittgenstein that a private language is not only possible but must exist; that work lays out some evidence for the existence of the "internal code" which is supposed to make up the data structures required by this concept.

Question: In an interview, Robert Brandom argued that this concept was an "attempt to show that asymmetric recognitive relations are metaphysically defective." Simone de Beauvoir explicitly drew on this concept in the first chapter of Part II of The Second Sex to explain gender relations. In his commentary on the philosopher who introduced this idea, Alexander Kojeve argued that this concept, viewed as a struggle for "recognition," was central to its formulator's philosophy, and that its resolution would bring about "the end of history." First introduced in its formulator's The System of Ethical Life, the work in which this concept was explicitly outlined claims that "self-consciousness exists in itself and for itself," and that one figure referenced by this idea "is mediated with itself through another consciousness;" thus, the first figure is independent, while the second is dependent. For 10 points, identify this key concept which shares its name with the passage from Hegel's PhenomenologyŠ of Spirit in which it's introduced, and which explores the interdependence of the two titular types of individuals.

Question: In an essay published on the fiftˆieth anniversary of the introduction of these concepts, Fred Dretske broke these concepts into two independent assumptions, and argued that for many philosophers, rejecting the closure principle that is the second assumption, brings "Armageddon." In order to address the critique presented by these concepts, Ernest Sosa formulated the triple-A criteria, which assess an action based on accuracy, adroitness, and aptness. In his book Thought, Gilbert Harman formulated the "no false lemmas" reply to the objections raised by these concepts, and Roderick Chisholm's most famous work used the concept of something being "evident" to counteract the critique originated by the formulator of these concepts. The paper which first formulated these concepts presented one of them in which Smith infers that Brown is in Barcelona on the grounds that Jones owns a Ford.

Question: A historically distinctive feature of this work's philosophy is its claim that while we do not have innate conceptions of things such as musical tones, we do possess innate conceptions of goodness. In a section "on sophistical arguments," this work suggests that an inference from premises should be admitted only if the premises at the end of the argument are the same as those that were initially granted. This work provides a tripartite definition of being good, which includes mastery of desires and aversions, movement toward and away from things, and freedom from deception and rashness. This work, whose third book contains an argument between an Epicurean and the man whose thought is contained in it, consists chiefl‚y of prescriptions for the good life, and begins with a description "Of the things which are in our power, and not in our power." The central points of this philosophical work would be summarized aˆfter the death of the man whose thought it contains by his student Arian into a short work known as the Manual, or the Enchiridion.

Question: The American philosopher Alexander Bryan Johnson proposed an "operational" theory of this concept, which partly titles his 1854 work about this idea. In his Mind and the World Order, C.I. Lewis outlined four modes of this concept, which he further divided between "holophrastic" and "analytic" instantiations. Michael Dummett published two essays both asking in the title, "What is a theory of," this concept, in which he argued against the truth-conditional theory of this idea. In a 1957 paper titled only by this concept, H.P. Grice argued that in order to fully understand this concept, the utterer's intentions must be taken into account. Hilary Putnam's "Twin Earth" thought experiment was intended to show that this concept "ain't just in the head," a position known as semantic externalism.

Question: A philosophical article by Fred Feldman distinguished between the "propositional" and the "sensory" forms of this concept, and was titled "Two Questions about" this phenomenon. In section 84 of A Theory of Justice, John Rawls argues that this concept cannot constitute the single rational end that is intended to guide deliberations. In his Theory of Moral Sentiments, Adam Smith argued that nothing generates this phenomenon quite like observing in others "a fellow feeling with all the emotions of our own breast." Henry Sidgwick argued that the only thing that the various instances of this phenomenon had in common was that they were all desirable, and thus proposed to define a measure of this phenomenon in terms of individual preferences in his The Methods of Ethics. Robert Nozick's argument against utilitarianism relied on our purported hesitation to plug ourselves into an "experience machine" that produced this phenomenon in unlimited amounts. Increasing the prevalence of this phenomenon was the basic idea behind Bentham's felicific calculus. For 10 points, identify this human emotion promoted by hedonistic philosophies.

Question: In the opening section from Beyond Good and Evil, "On the Prejudices of Philosophers," Nietzsche argues that along with "immediate certainty," and "absolute knowledge." this concept represents a contradiction. Otto Liebmann's seminal work on the originator of this concept argued that this concept must be abandoned in order to preserve the philosophical system developed by its originator. In an appendix to his own David Hume on Faith, Friedrich Jacobi criticized this concept by claiming that without it, he was unable to understand its originator's system, but with it, he could not remain within that system. Book II, Chapter 18 of Schopenhauer'sWorld as Will and Idea is titled aftˆer the "Possibility of Knowing," this concept, which in much of Schopenhauer's work is typically identified with the Will or an aspect of it. The work in which this concept first appears repeatedly claims that this concept is unknowable through "mere relations" or "external sense," which only provides us with a representation.

Question: Along with Montesquieu, this philosopher was the subject of much of Althusser's thought in the late 1950s, which culminated in Althusser's publication in 1960 of an essay on this thinker's "Philosophical Manifestoes." This thinker argued for a new philosophy grounded in sensation in opposition to Cartesian rationalism in his Principles for the Philosophy of the Future, and his late work, including the essay "On Spiritualism and Materialism," and the book On Moral Philosophy, was chiefl‚y concerned with the drive towards happiness. This philosopher was heavily criticized by Max Stirner in The Ego and His Own for bringing about only a "theoretical liberation," which only resulted in a "change of masters," and by Bruno Bauer, a fellow Young Hegelian, who attacked this thinker in an essay titled aˆer this man's "Characteristics." This thinker's most famous work draws heavily on D.F. Strauss' The Life of Jesus Critically Examined and claims that "theology is anthropology."

Question: An article whose title proclaims a new interpretation of this phenomenon considers two parties dubbed "ego" and "alter," and was expanded into Social Theory of International Politics; that essay is a foundational text of constructivism by Alexander Wendt. This concept is advanced by "superstitious faith... in machinery," and distinguished from "Fenianism," in a work that berates Nonconformists in the chapter "Our Liberal Practitioners" and contrasts "Hebraism" with "Hellenism." A utopian "post-scarcity" variant of this phenomenon was envisioned in a book by Murray Bookchin, and its "communistic" version was advocated in the book The Conquest of Bread by a man who also wrote the 1910 Encyclopedia Britannica article on this concept, Peter Kropotkin.

The fourth book of this work exhorts the reader to "purge out the old leaven and make clean the dwelling of your heart," to prepare for the sacrament, and the third book consists of ˆy-nine chapters of consolatory dialogue. The author of this work was infl‚uenced by the teachings of Gerard Groote and the Devotio Moderna movement. The parts "Of interior consolation" and "Of the Blessed Sacrament" comprise the last of its four sections. This work opens with the quote, "he who follows me walks not in darkness."

Question: A Lawrence Shapiro article titled aˆer this concept considers the example of a pair of corkscrews and compares the causal contribution of their material versus their color. David Lewis argued that this idea is not inconsistent with its opposite if it is made domain specific, using the example of a lottery having diff€erent winning numbers in diff€erent weeks. Arguments against this idea include the "denying projectability" reply, which uses the example of jade, and one which notes that this idea allows local structure-specifc bridge laws; those replies were formulated by Jaegwon Kim. This idea was generalized to occur within a single token system by Jerry Fodor, who used it to show that the special sciences cannot be reduced to physics. This idea was introduced in a series of papers attacking the identity thesis by Hilary Putnam, who considered the fact that many diff€erent kinds of animals feel pain, and is generally conceived of as a challenge to psychophysical reductionism. For 10 points, name this thesis from the philosophy of mind, which states that a single mental kind can have more than one physical instantiation.

Question: This philosopher reworked his paper "The Idea of Public Reason Revisited" into the second half of a book laying out eight principles for interactions among nations. This philosopher cited Kenneth Arrow to argue that good institutions form through a "four-stage sequence" of prior philosophizing, constitution-formation, legislature-selection, and bureaucracy-creation. This author of The Law of Peoples rejected utilitarian measurements of happiness, instead creating a list of "primary goods" valued by citizens, whom he argued possessed "two moral powers" that include following a "conception of the good." Michael Sandel criticized this philosopher's Kantian approach in a book on the "limits" of his most famous subject. This philosopher argued that without prior knowledge, people would maximize the amount of utility accorded to those lowest in status, in a thought experiment in which humans engineer society from behind a "veil of ignorance." For 10 points, name this liberal philosopher who conceived of the "original position" and the "di€fference principle" in A Theory of Justice.

Question: One section of this work argues that Hegel demoted this work's title concept to a mere "means of education," and credits Marx for restoring the idea of this work's title concept as the "subjection of political domination... to reason." This work's 15th section criticizes Mill and Tocqueville for "devalu[ing] the consequences" of a process they favored for the sake of principle, and it traces the beginnings of the title event partly to the Tory opposition in the 1720s. This work is critical of modern democracies and welfare states for allowing their citizenry to develop "a general attitude of demand," which subsumes genuine political interests under "administrative acts," thereby leading to a degeneration of the title concept. Tracing the origins of the title concept to modern understanding of the concept of a "private" citizen, this work analyzes the rise and fall of "coffee houses" and "salons" as the central loci of the title concept, which the author fears has been undermined by a transition from "culture-debating" to "culture-consuming." For 10 points, identify this work about the evolving dynamics of political participation, written by Jurgen Habermas.

Question: The first public discussion between these two thinkers was organized by Giovanna Borradori. These two men collaborated on a letter warning that "the avant-gardist core of Europe must not wall itself o€ into a new Small Europe," which was partly named for the protest-heavy date February 15 and drew on previous work from one of them about the "postnational constellation." One of these thinkers wrote a 1985 "Excursus" accusing the other of "leveling the genre distinction between philosophy and literature," and of having no framework to distinguish reason from unreason. Aftˆer both of these non-Americans were in New York on 9/11, they collaborated on Philosophy in a Time of Terror. These two academics wrote a 2003 "Plea for a Common Foreign Policy" calling for a unied Europe against George W. Bush, and eventually a "global public sphere" free of Eurocentric privileging. For 10 points, name these two philosophers, a Frenchman who took an "ethical turn" aˆfter writing Specters of Marx, and a German who warmed up to that deconstructionist aˆer blaming 9/11 on a failure of his theory of communicative action.

Question: One thinker described this movement as a Verwindung rather than an overcoming and as a convalescence after the replacement of metaphysics by hermeneutics; that is Gianni Vattimo's concept of "weak thought." Habermas argued that this movement's critique of communicative reason is a performative contradiction, because it fails to overcome the "paradox of self-referentiality." One thinker argued that this replaced the mode of "parody" grounded in societal norms with the collage-like mode of "pastiche" without reference to norms, and refers to this as "The (*) Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism." A different thinker claimed its salient feature is a skepticism towards the totalizing nature of teleological interpretations of events, which he called "metanarratives." For 10 points, name this cultural state that titles Fredric Jameson's magnum opus and whose "Condition" was described by Jean-François Lyotard.

Question: This man called the feature of thought that allows people who know how to say "John loves the girl" to also know how to say "the girl loves John" "systematicity" in a paper written with Zenon Pylyshyn. That paper by him argued that the connectionist approach to mind was unable to explain such properties. A book by this man used the example of optical illusions to argue that because we can know an image is illusory but still be unable to see it any other way, perception and language are (*) "informationally encapsulated" from the central system of thought. He called the confusion between his preferred philosophy of mind and dualism the "original sin of the Wittgensteinian tradition" and defended the thesis that thought relies on mental representations with a semantic structure.

Question: In a book on an earlier philosopher, this man discussed a representation of reality that can adequately account for all other true representations, claiming that while such an absolute conception exists for scientific inquiry, it does not for moral philosophy. This thinker used the story of Gauguin leaving his family to become a painter as an example of where rational and moral justifications clash. In one book, he argues that philosophers inevitably fail in trying to create an impartial ethical system that (*) transcends all cultures and individuals, and particularly attacks obligation-based morality's focus on "ethical purity." In an essay, this thinker wrote that morality's claim as an overriding value implies chance events can determine whether our decisions are right or wrong. An essay by Thomas Nagel further developed his concept of "moral luck." For 10 points, name this author of Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy.

Question: Steven Shapin and Simon Schaffer wrote a book analyzing a scientific debate in which this philosopher denied the existence of the concept of a vacuum. He defined "reason" as the mathematical reckoning of the consequences of agreed-upon names, and defined "right" as the liberty to make use of that faculty of reason. This philosopher, who wrote a treatise attacking the experiments of Robert Boyle, used the term "manners" to describe actions that allow men to live in peace in unity, these actions being forms of (*) "motion", which he believed to be the universal cause of all things. These definitions, some of which he originally formulated in De Homine and De Cive, were included in a work that advocates forming a Christian commonwealth to escape from the state of nature, which is "the war of all against all". For 10 points, name this English philosopher who argued for the concept of absolute sovereignty in his Leviathan.

Question: Robert Adams made a moral argument against the existence of these entities, as they make us powerless to do anything that would improve a situation. Another thinker attacked "ersatzist" theories of them in a book that distanced itself from the view of these as maximally consistent sets of propositions. These things are related to one another through accessibility relations, and a set of them with a set of accessibility relations forms a (*) frame. Counterpart theory holds objects can only exist in one of these; that theory was developed by David Lewis in his book "on the plurality" of these entities. Saul Kripke criticized treating these as "distant planets" we view dimly through a telescope and introduced the phrase "rigid designator" to define objects which are the same in all of these entities the objects inhabit.

Question: This philosopher argued against the possibility of an unordered universe with the analogy of deriving a function whose graph traces over randomly drawn points. He used the example of Alexander the Great to argue that a substance was a concept complete enough to allow all of its possible predicates to be deduced from it, and that consequently, any substance mirrors the properties of the entire universe. This man argued that for any (*) identical objects, any property of one is shared by the other, which is sometimes called his law. This author of Discourse on Metaphysics divided truths into "truths of reason," which rested on the principle of contradiction, and "truths of fact" which relied on a principle he described in his correspondence with Samuel Clarke: his principle of sufficient reason.

Question: This philosopher argued that giraffes are as socially constructed as bank accounts, for even if giraffes exist causally independently of humans, we define what they are. He described thinkers who are skeptical of epistemology and oppose the normalization of discourse as "edifying" rather than "systematic" philosophers. He argued against defining knowledge as an accurate representation of reality and for defining it as "what it is better for us to believe" in a work urging us to abandon the title (*) "ocular metaphor". This author of Philosophy and Social Hope wrote that Proust overcame the shame of his own finitude by ironizing his "final vocabulary" in a work whose third title concept is achieved by extending our conception of "we" to include others.

Question: John McDowell endorsed this thinker's view that raw experiences are endowed with rational content, allowing a spontaneous mind to still be receptive to empirical facts. A commentary on one of his works rejects most of it, but agrees that any self-conscious being aware of experiences must also be aware of objective realities, rebutting skepticism. In The Bounds of Sense, P.F. Strawson contends that (*) "transcendental deduction" is this man's most important contribution. Arthur Schopenhauer included an appendix of this thinker's errors in The World as Will and Representation, but also compared reading this man's writings to "a cataract operation on a blind person." This man hoped his own work would serve as a "Copernican Revolution" in philosophy, resolving the errors of rationalism and empiricism through his transcendental idealism.

Question: This work claims that the study of language was placed in a "quadrilateral" with corners of proposition, articulation, designation and derivation, in the chapter "Speaking." It argues that knowledge based on resemblance was replaced after the Renaissance by knowledge based on identity and difference. This book's preface describes its author's laughing response to a fictional Chinese encyclopedia that divides animals into absurd categories like "drawn with a...camelhair brush" in a passage by (*) Borges. It argues that fields such as natural history and general grammar are not ancestors of modern biology and linguistics, because all knowledge is limited to the episteme of its era. It precedes its author's turn towards a "genealogical" approach to history in works like Discipline and Punish.

Question: Book 4 of this work contains a list of definitions and is one of the books W.D. Ross claimed was inserted in by later editors. Genus, matter, universal, and essence are proposed as definitions of substance in Book 7, the last chapter of which declares a "new beginning" in examining its question. That chapter explains that a house is different from bricks and stones due to a cause, which the author equates with form; this illustrates its author's concept of (*) hylomorphism. A famously unclear passage appearing in chapters 7 through 10 of Book 12 of this work describes the active intellect, and a later chapter of that book introduces the "unmoved mover." This work's author called its subject matter "first philosophy," and its present name comes from its location in the standard curriculum developed by his students. For 10 points, name this book by Aristotle that studies "being qua being" and came after Physics.

Question: Anthony Kenny argued against viewing one part of this argument as skepticism about memory in his criticism of Norman Malcolm's analysis of it. Another work compares this argument to Hume's solution to the problem of causation, claiming that it shows how ordinary practices do not require the justification we think, even if we concede the impossibility of truth-conditions. The claim that this is a "skeptical solution to the skeptic's paradox" appears in a book that opens with the example of the (*) "quus function" and argues that it is a corollary of a larger argument about rule-following. That book is by Saul Kripke. The reader is asked to imagine a person who writes "S" every time he feels a sensation in its original formulation in Philosophical Investigations. For 10 points, name this argument by Ludwig Wittgenstein against a system of communication available to only one person.

Question: One work distinguishes this concept from lust, by suggesting that this concept does not impel us to possess an object. Francis Hutcheson argued that this concept arises through the possession of "uniformity amidst variety". One thinker claimed that to apply this concept is to simultaneously demand agreement while admitting of disinterest in an object's real existence. This concept titles a book that distinguishes between work and (*) play, to separate moral value from valuing this concept, which is discussed as "the manifestation of God to the senses". One work claims that this concept stems from sympathy and the "social passions", and contrasts it with a concept that instills a feeling of terror or awe. George Santayana defined it as "the objectification of pleasure" in a work title for The Sense of this concept. For 10 points, name this primary subject of aesthetic philosophy, which is often opposed to "the sublime".

Question: A movement named for this event was sparked by a 1961 book, in which the argument that it arose from the absence of transcendence in the modern world was put forth by Gabriel Vahanian. Charles Taylor claimed that belief in this event is one of the dominant modern "closed world structures," which arises from both contemporary moral experience and scientific advancement, and that belief in it arises from the belief that the "immanent frame" is all-containing. G.W.F. Hegel claimed that this event signified a "reversal" and "the negation of negation." Despite this event, shadows will continue to be exhibited in caves "for millenniums yet"; in another text, which wonders what "festivals of atonement" or "sacred games" must be invented in the wake of this event, a madman alleges that all of humanity was responsible for it. For 10 points, name this event postulated by Friedrich Nietzsche in The Gay Science and Also Sprach Zarathustra.

Question: This book illustrates a concept whose only norm is sophrosune with an artistic description of the top half of Raphael's Transfiguration. This book, which compares ancient "cheerfulness" with Schiller's modern "naivete," cites Gotthold Lessing's refusal to receive perfect knowledge from God to attack the "theoretical man." Ulrich Wilamowitz made his career with an attack on this book. It quotes Schopenhauer's description of a sailor in a storm illustrating the principium individuationis and uses "the phenomenon," or maya, and the mask as equivalents for a concept it identifies with illusion. This book argues that the dialogue of a play and its chorus, respectively, belong to the realms of "dreams" and "drunkenness." The author called this book "dubious" and links its writing to the tumult of the Franco-Prussian War in an 1886 "Attempt at Self-Criticism." For 10 points, name this book that outlines the Apollonian and Dionysian drives and praises Richard Wagner, by Friedrich Nietzsche.

Question: The nomological varieties of this concept are enumerated as material, consequentialist, and inclusive in a paper by Ernest Sosa. In a 1986 paper, another thinker argued that any theory that explains this concept must also explain the "chancy" type of it by using the example of a bomb hooked up to a Geiger counter. A book by John Mackie that examines statistical laws and their relationship to this concept is titled Cement of the Universe; that book refutes David Lewis's attempt to explain this concept with conditional counterfactuals and proposes "regularity" theory as an explanation for this idea. Another argument about this idea suggests that humans understand it inductively only through instances of the "copy principle," by using the example of one billiard ball hitting another billiard ball. For 10 points, name this concept articulated as a "necessary connection" in David Hume's An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, which can be used to explain the relationship between two events.

Question: This text reminds readers that the grammarian Priscian would have approved of Augustine's instruction in On Christian Doctrine for the Christian teacher to leave out the confusing bits of dogma. The prologue to this text opens by citing Matthew 19:28, in a discussion of why one should not judge. It analyzes Boethius's claim in the Topics that accident and substance were the two "primary kinds of things" and develops an argument about the prevalence of "opinion." This text adopts the dialectical approach of Gratian in a section that opens with the inquiry of whether human faith must be "completed by reason" and goes on to ask whether faith only concerns unseen things, and whether there is any knowledge of unseen things. It states that if "God permits errors to befall the saints themselves, this occurs in matters which do no harm to the faith," and presents 158 questions in an attempt to resolve inconsistencies between church fathers. For 10 points, name this text by Peter Abelard.

Question: This philosophical position was influentially stated in a 1956 paper by John Kemeny and Paul Oppenheim. The champions of this position's "new wave" include Clifford Hooker and John Bickle. Another influential model of this position, which was amended by Kenneth Schaffner, distinguishes between homogeneous and heterogeneous forms of this position's central concept, and relies on derivations assisted by bridge laws. In The Structure of Science, Ernest Nagel set forth his model of this position. Dan Dennett's book Darwin's Dangerous Idea supports a form of this position that attempts to explain apparent design without "skyhooks," rather than without "cranes." The argument from multiple realizability opposes this position, which is attacked along with the analytic-synthetic distinction in W.V.O. Quine's "Two Dogmas of Empiricism."

Question: The two central figures of this text are compared to "two bald men searching for a comb" in Soren Kierkegaard's dissertation. The first paragraph of J. S. Mill's Utilitarianism cites this text as foundational. It claims that pleasure is the good and one cannot be overcome by good, so the state of being "overcome by pleasure" can only result from ignorance. One man in this text describes how all species but humans received a special power at creation because Epimetheus forgot. Several men lift the ailing Prodicus out of bed in this text, in which the poetic lines from Simonides, "for a man to become good is truly hard" and "hard it is to be good," are contrasted. This dialogue is set in the house of Callias, and concludes with Socrates undermining his own argument by stating that the central concept is knowledge, and knowledge can be learned. For 10 points, name this Platonic dialogue in which Socrates debates whether virtue can be taught with a Sophist who claimed that "man is the measure of all things."

He included two diagrams of the human eye in the fourth chapter of a book arguing that coexistence is only possible through the union of time and space. He discussed the "subject in volition" as the immediate object of inner sense in a book, inspired by Aristotle's explanatory doctrines, that posits "willing," "being," "knowing," and "becoming" as necessary connections with the different classes of objects it identifies. He appended a critique of the transcendental analytic in Kantian philosophy to a later book in which he connected the Kantian ding-an-sich with the human will.

That author from this country wrote Language of the Triple Goddess and was the first formulator of the "kurgan hypothesis." Jacques Derrida criticized a philosopher born in this country for his concept of the "rupture of phenomenology" in the essay "Violence and Metaphysics." This country's official language is the most conservative extant Indo-European language. This country is home to the Romuva religious movement, which seeks to revive the worship of deities like Saule and Perkunas.

Question: An article that tries to explain the limits of this concept advocates transcendental naturalism and introduces the idea of cognitive closure to argue that humans are incapable of ever articulating this concept. A book on this topic that advocates "constructive naturalism" to explain "The Missing Shade of You" was written by Owen Flanagan and is named for this concept "reconsidered." The unknowability of this concept is accepted by New Mysterians, which is promoted by sexual harasser Colin McGinn, who talks about this concept in The Mysterious Flame. Joseph Levine argues that a physical substrate is potentially necessary to understand this idea in a paper that introduces "the explanatory gap." A science of this concept using first-person and third-person data is advocated by David Chalmers, who also introduced the "hard" form of the "problem" of this concept. For 10 points, a philosophical problem requires an explanation of what state of being aware?

Question: In a letter to St. Denis, this thinker used the term sygkephalaiosis to describe his belief that those who receive a miracle have just consummated their relationship with God. In one of this thinker's works, he likened the image of God to the most vile of creatures, a worm. In that same work, he compared the secrets of God to the mystery of a secret object wrapped in light that is wrapped in darkness. Another of this thinker's works uses the example of Moses on Mount Sinai to argue that once one learns the divine secrets, one only knows silence and unknowing. Another of this man's works posits that the church is inhabited by eight types of people, the lowest of whom are the "demon-possessed." This Neo-Platonist wrote On the Divine Names and The Celestial Hierarchy, which states that the seraphim are the highest order of angels. For 10 points, name this religious thinker who put forth the angelic hierarchy, an Areopagite whose name suggests that he was the "pseudo" version of a Greek god.

Question: A controversy over this man's religious thought prompted a pamphlet on David Hume's use of a word for "belief." That word, "glaube," was roundly derided in an 18th-century controversy about this man's thought sparked by a conversation about him between Gotthold Lessing and Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi, the latter of whom maintained that this man was a materialist. In his own time, he was castigated for pointing out that the Bible is "imperfect, corrupt, erroneous, and inconsistent with itself," and fragmentary. In this man's major text on religion, he claimed that the persistence of Jews as a race was mainly due to their fastidiousness in requiring circumcision, and that the Torah should not be followed because it was only fit to serve as the state constitution of ancient Israel. This man's central religious belief was of "Deus sive Natura," signifying his belief that nature and God consisted of one and the same substance.

Question: In a book named for these things, one of them called "The Curse of the Cauliflower" is used by the author to show that isolating subjective experiences, such as the way a particular food tastes to someone, is impossible. In that 1995 book, the author claimed that another of these constructs is the talent that people have for interpreting the people around them, which is called "folk psychology." In a book about "The Varieties of Free Will Worth Wanting," the author argues that Rene Descartes's "cogito ergo sum" statement is one of these concepts that has beguiled philosophy for 300 years. These concepts were first introduced in the book Elbow Room, which stated that a thought experiment proposed by John Searle, the Chinese Room experiment, is one of them because it appeals to the imagination instead of presenting a soundly derived arguments from principles.

Question: This work is the first title subject of a 1963 commentary by J.L. Ackrill, who proposed that it was written by iteratively asking questions. Immanuel Kant, who claimed that this work's author "picked up" the title concepts "as they occurred to him," expanded on this work to propose four "pure concepts of understanding" that form the basis of his "table of judgments." Chapters 5 through 9 of this work focus on "ta lagomena," or "things that are said," and expand on a ten-fold list that consists of "when," "where," "having," "doing," "relative," "qualification," "being affected," "being in position," "substance," and "quantity" in its middle section, which is typically called the "Praedicamenta."

Question: In a 1973 text, a philosopher argued that this theory produces the wrong "sort of considerations...into finding the answer" to problems posed by the examples of "Jim and the Indians" or "George and the arms manufacturers." Another objection to this theory is that it allows "no rest." In an adversarial collaboration with J.J.C. Smart, Bernard Williams stated that the day when people stop discussing this theory "cannot be too far off," and advanced the "integrity objection" to it. The fact that, for a population of at least 10 billion, there could exist some larger population whose sum-total existence would be better even though individuals had lives barely worth living is a simple formulation of Derek Parfit's counterexample to this theory dubbed the "repugnant conclusion."

Question: This book uses the fact that the Zulu term for "far away" is "a place where one cries 'mother, I am lost'" to illustrate its central observation that "the world is twofold for man in accordance with his twofold attitude." One section of this book begins by "contemplat[ing] a tree" that, on one hand, can be accepted as a picture, felt as a movement, assigned a species, stripped of its uniqueness, or dissolved into a number, or on the other hand, can be "drawn into a relation" with the observer. The contrast between "experience" and "encounter" is central to this book, which is divided into three sections of aphorisms and argues that an ideal society should be built on a person's relationship with others. The third section of this book is a manual for preparing one's self for an "absolute encounter" with God, who is described as the "eternal you."

Question: In an anecdote illustrating this quality, the painter Apelles throws a sponge in frustration at his effort to paint the foam on a horse's mouth, only then succeeding in doing so. In The Will to Power, Friedrich Nietzsche denied that this quality equates with psychic health, because the desire for it is emblematic of nihilism and symptomatic of decadence. Michel de Montaigne's "Apology for Raymond Sebond" discusses how Zeno's conception of the division of the faculties of the soul as analogous to positions of his hand leads to belief in this "straight and inflexible" quality. Diogenes Laertius's story of a pig that ate calmly on a ship during a storm led Pyrrho to state that this quality was an ideal state of being in which people live in accordance with their nature. Sextus Empiricus said that it could be brought about by epoche, or suspension of judgment, and the Stoics associated it with apatheia. For 10 points, name this state of robust tranquility that Epicurus thought was the ideal condition for humans.

Question: One argument in this work is that previously ignored âinner strifeâ and âintrinsic contradictorinessâ explain why a central concept has âlift[ed] off from itselfâ to become established âin the clouds.â The beginning of this work criticizes the conception that only the âtheoreticalâ attitude is a genuine human attitude, and thus, that practice is only the âdirty-judaical manifestationâ of theory. This work draws a distinction between contemplation-based and practical-experience-based âsensuousnessâ in its critique of existing theories of materialism. This work, which was first published as an appendix to a pamphlet titled for a certain person âand the End of Classical German Philosophy,â was originally a sketch of the first chapter of its authorâs The German Ideology. Its final section states that âphilosophers have hitherto only interpreted the world in various ways; the point is to change it.â For 10 points, name this set of 11 notes about the author of The Essence of Christianity, by Karl Marx.

He defined beauty as "uniformity amidst variety" and said that a square was more beautiful than a triangle. This man's equation "B equals M over A" helps calculate the benevolence of an action as equaling the moment of good divided by our ability to do good. This author of Thoughts on Laughter described beauty as an instinct that is raised or triggered in us when we see a beautiful thing, and he compared the way we sense good and evil to the way we sense sweetness and bitterness. A sense of beauty and a moral sense were both described by this author, who wrote a materialist interpretation of Lord Shaftesbury's "universal benevolence" theory in his System of Moral Philosophy.

Question: Joseph Raz has argued against the inclusive or "soft" version of this position because it misconstrues the nature of authority. One proponent of this position argued that this position's subjects have a core and a penumbra in order to dodge a critique launched by Lon L. Fuller. A book written to defend this position described the importance of a secondary "rule of recognition" that would serve as a test of validity.

Question: In a 1973 paper, Donald Davidson argued that radical interpretation requires that one simultaneously provide a theory of meaning and a theory of this concept. Quine wrote a 1956 paper in which he examined the case of a citizen named Ralph and a mayor named Bernard J. Ortcutt as a way of explaining how quantification works over contexts relevant to these concepts; that paper is widely held to have originated the de re/de dicto distinction between two types of this concept. Saul Kripke postulated the existence of a bilingual Frenchman named Pierre who utters the sentences "Londres est jolie" and "London is not pretty," but does not know that Londres is London in order to illustrate a "puzzle" concerning this concept.

John Earman has constructed a Bayesian characterization of the most famous argument about these concepts, holding that the best-known work about them is an "abject failure." In a 1968 paper partially devoted to the refutation of an argument by Anthony Flew, Roger Swinburne argued that there could exist sufficiently strong historical evidence for these phenomena. The most famous argument against these phenomena establishes that "uniform experience" is a "direct and full proof" against them," which "cannot be destroyed... but by an opposite proof which is superior," and concludes that "mere reason" or personal testimony is insufficient to ever convince one of the truth of Christianity.

This philosopher argued that "psychological state does not determine extension" in a paper that aimed to show that its title concept was not "in the head" by positing a world in which water was not H2O but rather XYZ. For 10 points, identify this American philosopher who postulated a "Twin Earth" in his paper "The Meaning of 'Meaning' and argued that we could not be "brains-in-a-vat."

Question: In 2002, Huw Price established a center for the study of this concept at the University of Sydney. A form of modal logic whose operators reflect various aspects of this phenomenon was developed by Arthur Prior. Peter van Inwagen called himself a "threeist" in a paper that attempted to establish a theory of identity relative to this phenomenon via a thought experiment involving a "flatlander" version of Descartes. Section II of the Critique of Pure Reason, which is dedicated to this concept, calls it "nothing else than the form of the internal sense," rather than any "determination of outward phenomena," as well as "the formal condition a priori of all phenomena whatsoever." A famous argument about this phenomenon divides it into an A-series and a B-series, and argues that although the A-series is necessary for it to exist, the existence of the A-series leads to a contradiction, and therefore this phenomenon is illusory. For 10 points, identify this phenomenon which does not exist according to an argument by John McTaggart.

Question: In one work, this thinker explored Descartes' "project of pure enquiry" and its failure to provide an "absolute conception" of reality, and in another work, imagined that "the day cannot be too far off... in which we shall hear no more" of a certain philosophical doctrine. This thinker began with a "sub-Humean" model of motivation in a paper that concluded that only "internal reasons" rather than "external reasons" exist. This philosopher denied the possibility of doing moral philosophy from what he called an "Archimedean point," outside of all knowledge, and called morality, "the peculiar institution" that we "would be better off without," in his 1985 work Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy. In a notable paper, answered by a paper of the same title by Thomas Nagel, this philosopher used the story of Gauguin to argue that moral justifications are not independent of fortune. For 10 points, identify this British philosopher who took the "against" side in a book co-authored with J.J.C. Smart titled Utilitarianism: for and against, and coined the term "moral luck."

Question: Using this rule allows one to add additional terms to the left-hand sides of hypotheses in the deduction theorem; in that case, the form of this principle used is known as Pierce's law. The so-called consequentia mirabilis relies only on this result. This is the first derived statement in the Principia Mathematica, which proves it by taking the disjunction of the modus ponens and modus tollens to yield "p implies q equals not p or q," then considering what happens if q is allowed to be p. Polyvalent logics are ones lacking this rule, and N-valued logics have versions of this rule applying to N minus one disjunctions of mutual exclusions. Sometimes confused with the principle of bivalence, this law was first stated in Aristotle's On Interpretation as the principle of non-contradiction. For 10 points, name this law of classical logic according to which "p or not p" is true for any p, since no other result is possible.

ANSWER: law of the excluded middle [or law of the excluded third; accept Pierce's law before read; accept principle of non-contradiction before read]

Question: This thinker's dialectic defines genuine knowledge to be not only a perfect correspondence with reality, but also universally agreed upon by all people, and therefore impossible. He rejected Kantian ethics, arguing for a morality that balances individual diversity of morals and commitment to the whole of humanity in his Soliloquies and in On Religion: Speeches to Its Cultural Despisers. He argued that different definitions of a word are interdependent due to the so-called unity of the word-sphere. His twin vocations can be seen in his Dialectic, or, The Art of Doing Philosophy and his Brief Outline for the Study of Theology. He argued that rules of interpretation must be universal across texts, must be non-linguistic, and must include interpretation based on the psychology of the author. For 10 points, name this late-18th and early-19th century German theologian and philosopher, often regarded as the father of hermeneutics.

Question: One text on this subject asks if "egoism is to check egoism," and observes that "for a while at least the law can preserve its privileges against unprivileged egoism." That text, which was published in 1842, was attacked the following year in an essay that summarized its position as saying "we must emancipate ourselves before we can emancipate others"; that essay claims that it is only "in the North American states" that this subject loses its "theological significance and becomes a really secular" one. Another text on this subject that was published a century later attacks such authors as Edouard Drumont and Charles Maurras, and distinguishes between "authentic" and "inauthentic" types of a certain individual. Those texts were written by Bruno Bauer, Karl Marx, and Jean-Paul Sartre, whose "reflections" on this subject appeared just after World War II.

Question: An argument based on causal closure and the rejection of overdetermination grounds Jaegwon Kim's defense of a kind of physicalism based on this concept. Jerry Fodor and Hilary Putnam have argued that multiple realizability undermines this concept and preserves the autonomy of "special sciences." The "greedy" version of this concept is dismissed, while a more modest form is defended through the metaphor of a crane, in Darwin's Dangerous Idea by Daniel Dennett. Along with the analytic-synthetic divide, a semantic form of this concept is one of the "Two Dogmas of Empiricism" Quine claimed to have refuted. Ernest Nagel identified this concept with the process of showing a theory to be logical consequence of a "base" theory via bridge laws. For 10 points, name this concept that most commonly refers to the ability of observations about an entity to be explained as solely the interactions of its parts.

Question: In a 1976, Michael Stocker condemned competing approaches to this theory as "schizophrenic" for failing to examine "motives and motivational structures." An agent-based variant of this theory that takes inspiration from Frances Hutchenson and James Martineau, among others, was developed by Michael Slote. A book advocating this theory begins by imagining a world in which science has been destroyed and subsequently revived, although it is practiced without true understanding, and argues that this is the situation of one particular branch of philosophy. The development of this theory was largely inspired by G. E. M. Anscombe's paper "Modern Moral Philosophy," and it looks back to concepts such as arete, phronesis, and eudaemonia. Advocated by Alisdair MacIntyre, among others, as a neo-Aristotelian approach, for 10 points, identify this theory of moral philosophy which investigates qualities conducive to the "flourishing" of a human being.

Scholars cite this work using the Academy pagination numbers from 5:3 (five three) through 5:163. Three nameless Theorems in this book argue that "determining grounds for the will" can include the mere form in which a principle is posited, not just its matter. This work introduces its author's idea of the summum bonum as the joining of virtue with happiness. This work's conclusion notes that humans find awe in two things: "the starry heavens above, and the (*) moral law within," after showing that the title concept compels us to believe in God's existence, free will, and the immortality of the soul. This work is meant to establish, rather than delimit, the "pure" subtype of the title mental faculty.

This work revisits a Sophocles play discussed in an earlier work by the author, and suggests that Antigone represents the tragic collision of two forms of the title concept. Walter (*) Kaufmann, in a work about the methods of mythologizing this text's author, suggests that Popper's critique of this book's author as a "false prophet" is partially based on a gross mistranslation of a phrase from this work, "the State is the March of God through the World."

Alfred Tarski believed sentences could be judged for this quality and set out criteria for doing so. Like Kurt Gödel [GUR-dul], Tarski also wrote that some sentences with this property could not be proved. This quality is sometimes considered equivalent to the number one in Boolean algebra, and this is sometimes confused with validity. Name this concept that in some approaches is used to describe statements that match reality, in contrast to falsehood.

Question: This philosopher claimed that Arab astronomers did not understand that Ptolemaic epicycles were not intended to represent real physical events in his essay collection To Save the Phenomena, which covers similar ground as his ten-volume history of cosmology which praises the role of the Catholic Church in advancing medieval science, entitled The System of World. This thinker claimed that science is only a "calculating device" for predicting manifestations of reality, and does not reveal truths about nature itself, in his magnum opus, The Aim and Structure of Physical Theory. This philosopher lends his name to a theory of underdetermination in physics, which notes that a hypothesis depends on other hypotheses and cannot be tested in isolation. For 10 points, name this philosopher and physicist whose namesake thesis was extended to all empirical knowledge by Willard van Orman Quine.

Question: This book explains the role of circumstances in truth by justifying a grammar-school textbook's inclusion of the claim "Lord Raglan won the battle of Alma," and it declares that it will "play Old Harry with" both "the true/false fetish" and "the value/fact fetish." One concept in this book is explained as possibly failing due to a lack of "uptake," such as the refusal of a bet. The example of naming a ship the Queen Elizabeth is described in this book as a "misfire," which lacks authority, as opposed to an "abuse." Those are ways in which this book's condition of being "felicitous" might not be met. This book divides a concept, based on whether it requires an effect in order to succeed, into illocutions and perlocutions, the latter of which might include alarming or persuading. For 10 points, name this book which discusses various kinds of "speech acts" and was written by J.L. Austin.

Question: This thinker claimed that knowledge of one's own mental state, the mental states of others, and the external world must "rise and fall" together in a book claiming that shared linguistic understanding is a necessary condition for objectivity, Three Varieties of Knowledge. He claims that all theories about the actions of others will "find them consistent believers of the truths and lovers of the good" in his "principle of charity." An early book by this man states that belief-desire pairs are the combinations of propositional attitudes that constitute both the reasons and causes of actions. He proposed that, while all thought and action must be describable as physical events, there are no universal laws which can predict thought on the basis of physics, in his paper "Mental Events." For 10 points, name this author of "Radical Interpretation" who formulated the theory of anomalous monism.

Question: In one book, this thinker claimed that political meaning is "the absolute horizon of all reading and all interpretation" and claimed that Saussure was the origin of the decoupling of language and knowledge from politics; that is his book denouncing structuralism, The Prison-House of Language. He wrote a study accusing Wyndham Lewis of being a fascist, Fables of Aggression. A major book by this author noted that high culture and mass culture "implode" together in a "new depthlessness" that replaces parody with pastiche and eliminates the "critical distance" needed to avoid being an "embellishment to society." He claims that the title concept's "rejection of totality" renders it part of the current economic system in that book. For 10 points, name this left-wing thinker who attacked authors such as Derrida for undermining the classical Marxist project in his book Postmodernism: The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism.

Question: One philosopher with this surname concludes that, because moral judgments do not correspond to a previously held desire, they are either not beliefs or not able to motivate, and therefore cannot be both objective and practical. This surname is held by the Australian philosopher Michael, who wrote The Moral Problem, and by the coiner of the term "evolutionarily stable strategy" who wrote The Evolutionary Theory of Games, Maynard. Another philosopher with this surname noted that because love comes from a "habit of the imagination," it is difficult for a third party to sympathize with, but that most people hold the "social passions" in high esteem. That man with this name wrote about judging actions through the "impartial spectator" in the Theory of Moral Sentiments. For 10 points, give this surname of the philosopher who described the division of labor in a pin factory in The Wealth of Nations, Adam.

That philosopher from this country criticized Heidegger for not addressing the role of physical space in his book about the origins of national characters, Climate and Culture. Another philosopher from this country explained the theory of "twofold being-in-the-world" in a series of commentaries on another philosopher from this country, who used the "logic of place" to try to analyze the concept of "pure experience" without reference to an external world. This country is where An Inquiry Into the Good was written by the leader of a philosophical circle that practiced "cooperative resistance" during World War II.

Question: In a major book, this philosopher divided six "wings" into the footprints, image, and actuality of God. This author of the regulatory "Constitutions of Narbonne" wrote a biography of the man who originally saw a six-winged angel at Mount Alverna. This formulator of an aitiological argument used the proposition that knowledge of truth leads to knowledge of divine light to put forth his "illuminationist" case for the existence of God. He was able to mediate the dispute between the Spirituals and the Relaxati after defending his order from attacks by William of Saint-Amour and becoming minister-general of the Franciscans.

Question: In a book about this concept, Michael Theunissen argues that its most notable theorist saw it as "the desire of the self to not be what it is". Its "demonic" kind is identified as the refusal to accept forgiveness, and its "second-order" kind as belief in the impossibility of forgiveness. In the chapter "Equilibrium Between the Aesthetic and the Ethical in the Composition of Personality", Judge Wilhelm lectures against this concept and labels it the choice to let one's life depend on conditions that cannot be controlled. A later book on this affliction claims that it arises when the self does not acknowledge "the power that constituted it."

Question: This philosopher wrote that the four elements of every social being are personality, profession, quality, and quantity. This author of a forgotten thirty-three volume history of Sweden identified humanity, Christianity, and citizenship as the three types of ordered communities. His anonymous pamphlet, The Laws of the German Empire, noted that the Holy Roman Empire was neither aristocracy, monarchy, nor democracy, and thus its constitution was a "monster." He attempted to synthesize all strains of natural law into a book explaining how monarchies emerge from the state of nature in a rational way, based on the influence of Erhard Weigel and Hugo Grotius.

This author of "Systematically Misleading Expressions" advocated "removing conceptual roadblocks" and "freeing conceptual traffic jams" in a book about the need to analyze what can be said without absurdity and determine the "logical geography" of language, Dilemmas. He claimed that linguistic ambiguity can mislead one into thinking that mental and physical activities are both separate and on par with each other, thus committing a "category mistake" that leads to a belief in Cartesian dualism or the conception of the mind-body relationship as a "ghost in the machine."

Question: A late book by this philosopher extended his ideas to international relations and called for a federative world government; that was his Principle of Federation. A book by this philosopher seeks to negate all "immutable and permanent" things in praise of "the affirmation of universal movement." This author of The Philosophy of Progress explained his ideal state in General View of the Revolution in the Nineteenth Century. An earlier book by this man made a distinction between "jus in re" rights to products and "jus ad rem" rights to means of production in calling for limiting ownership to the amount of land and tools actually used in craftsmanship. That book was praised as "the first decisive examination" of the title institution by Marx and led Bakunin to dub this man "the father of us all."

Question: The last section of this work examines various diseases and ends with a description of how bodies would be thrown onto pyres intended for others, causing civil strife. This work alleges that the mind and body are interconnected via a single substance, although the mind is composed of at least three substances, plus one more "which is quite nameless." In a section on sensations, this work imagines that vision must operate via "films" that are ejected from objects into the eye, and proposes that embryonic material to make up children comes from both parents. This work hypothesizes that in the past, "many species must have died out altogether," and that "creatures with a double nature" such as centaurs never existed, and its section on matter and space contains the famous assertion that the universe consists of indivisible atoms.

Question: This work alleges that "All great deeds... have a ridiculous beginning," and imagines a "strangeness" that causes one to perceive that the world is "dense." A figure in this work is deemed not to be melancholy because "he knows and does not hope," and this work alleges that it is a mistake to look on works of art as "a series of isolated testimonies." This work contains a notable afterword concerning "hope and the absurd in the work of Franz Kafka," and other literary figures analyzed in this work include Kirilov from The Possessed and Don Juan. This work opens by declaring that "There is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide," and imagines its title figure as a "proletarian of the gods" and an "absurd hero" who contemplates his wretched condition during his descent.

Question: Most of the original work in this book is contained in sections known as the "Oremarks" and this work drew on the Talmud for the style of its composition, while its philosophical methods owe a debt to Roderigo Arriaga. Leibniz's Theodicy was largely an attempt to refute this work's views regarding Manicheanism, and this work's section on "Rorarius" contained the first attack on Leibniz's theory of monads. Its original intent was to supplement a similar work of Louis Moreri, and its publication occurred after its author had engaged in a longstanding feud with Pierre Jurieu following that author's publication of notes regarding the passage of a comet. The author of this work was later published a series of Eclarissements, or "Clarifications," of his writings on topics such as skepticism and atheism, and this work's section on "David" was accused of using Scripture to introduce obsenities to the public.

Question: Galen Strawson argued against this concept a 1983 work which examined the "cognitive phenomenology" of belief in it. In a paper which concerned this idea and the "Concept of a Person," Harry Frankfurt argued that it is connected to second-order desires, and paradoxes concerning this idea are sometimes known as "Frankfurt cases," due to a 1969 paper of his. John Martin Fischer has proposed a "Garden of Forking Paths" model of this idea, and in a book in which he coined the notions of sphexishness and intuition pumps, Elbow Room, Daniel Dennett wrote about the "varieties" of this which are "worth wanting." Non-causal, event-causal, and agent-causal accounts of this idea belong to incompatibilist theories of it, while compatibilist theories of this idea attempt to reconcile it with determinism.

Benjamin Constant Botelho de Magalhaes led this movement in Brazil, where it became so popular in the late 19th century that one of its slogans was placed on Brazil's national flag. In France, this movement split between the followers of Emile Littre and Pierre Laffitte. English supporters of this movement included Richard Congreve, who founded the first of its "churches of humanity." The founder of this movement created a new calendar with months named for Homer and Aristotle, and classified the fundamental sciences into a hierarchy beginning with mathematics and ending with "social physics," which he would later call "sociology."

In Naming and Necessity, Saul Kripke argued that this phenomenon was not "picked out by one of its accidental properties," but rather "by its immediate phenomenological quality," and that it was absurd to suggest that it could exist without being a mental state. An article by David Lewis drew on a theory by David Armstrong to characterize this phenomenon as "a state that occupies a certain causal role;" that paper called it a "non-rigid" concept and argued that "a credible theory of mind needs to make a place for both" the "mad" and the "Martian" varieties of this phenomenon.

In that work, this philosopher argued that different theorists have been "climbing the same mountain on different sides," and proposed what he called the "triple theory." That triple theory of this philosopher holds that to be right, an act must not be disallowed by "principles that are optimific, uniquely universally willable, and not reasonably rejectable," and is elucidated in his On What Matters. This philosopher's most famous work employs the mere addition paradox to formulate an anti-consequentialist argument according to which a society with high aggregate happiness due to a large number of people who are all miserable is paradoxically superior to a society with fewer people, all of whom have a high quality of life.

That paper argues that these concepts allow us to switch from belief conditions to truth conditions when it comes to evaluating conditional statements. One philosopher notable for his use of these concepts attacked three forms of "ersatzism," which held that these entities are abstract rather than concrete. The belief that these entities are concrete is known as modal realism, and was advanced by a philosopher who used quantification over these constructs in his analysis of counterfactuals, David Lewis. In Naming and Necessity, Saul Kripke defines his notion of the rigid designator as one that designates the same object in all of these. For 10 points, identify these philosophical constructs often attributed to Gottfried Leibniz, who argued in his Theodicy that we live in the best of all of them.

Question: This philosopher outlined a sort of "dark anonymous being" called the "il y a," or the "there is," which is perceived in the absence of light; he thus characterized consciousness as a "hypostasis." This author included an essay on his longtime friend Maurice Blanchot in Proper Names, and his collection Of God Who Comes to Mind is an example of his Talmudic scholarship. He contrasted how the subject can experience a jouissance of the impersonal world with how that same subject must respond to the commandment, "Thou shalt not kill" when faced with the "widow, orphan, or stranger." A survivor of the Holocaust, this author of Otherwise than Being or Beyond Essence claimed that Heidegger's unforgiveable Nazism arose from Western philosophy's reliance on ontology and its tendency to incorporate everything into "the Same."

One section claims all philosophical minds are defined by whether they're prone to look for similarities or differences in things. The preface addresses "true sons of knowledge" to propose two sets of methods called "Anticipation of the Mind" and "Interpretation of Nature." This work attacks syllogisms since they're substitutes for thoughts in its first book, which outlines two manifestations of a concept: the names of things that do not exist, or unsuitably vague names for things such as the term "earth." This work describes misconceptions where a person solely trusts his own experience as man living in "a cave of his own," which is listed along with the "marketplace" and the "theatre" as descriptive beliefs referred to as "idols."

Question: This philosopher wrote an article arguing that phrases of the form "the so-and-so" imply existence rather than assert existence, and in that article he distinguished sentences, uses, and utterances. He began another article by claiming to not know "what the thesis of determinism is" before suggesting a compromise between optimists and pessimists through an appeal to "reactive attitudes." He claimed emotions show that determinism has no affect on moral obligation in "Freedom and Resentment." This philosopher rejected Kant's transcendental idealism for violating the "principle of significance" in The Bounds of Sense. In another work, he suggests the existence of a "master-sound" and argues against the no-ownership view of self.

Question: This work frequently refers to the audience, the author, and other thinkers as "beginning philosophers," and its third and fourth sections build up to the assertion that a certain philosophical method is equivalent to transcendental idealism. Its fifth and longest section is dedicated to addressing the "grave objection" of the problem of "other egos," according to which this work's project becomes solipsistic. This work's first section analyzes conditions of the apodicticity of evidence and faults a philosophical forerunner for failing to make the "transcendental turn."

Question: These entities underlie a theory of natural history found in the Syntagma Philosophicum. One thinker attempted to undermine a paradox about these entities by claiming that "all perception is true." Under one theory, these entities did not explain properties that exist "by convention," but instead explained only "reality." Aristotle considered the existence of these entities absurd in his On Generation and Corruption, which claims that they were first postulated to address the possibility of (*) change. These entities, which are central to Pierre Gassendi's theories, "swerve" to meet one another, thus explaining free will, according to Epicurus.

Question: The author of this work speaks of "the woman-god [who] demands our veneration, the god-like woman [who] kindles our love" while describing a statue which he believes represents Juno Ludovisi. One section of this work argues that only the title kind of "disposition of the soul," gives birth to liberty, pointing out that "the delightfull flower... will never unfold itself in the case of the Troglodyte." The 19th section of this work distinguishes between two different states of passive and active capacity, arguing that the opposition between those states "preserves an entire freedom between them both," while earlier, the author postulates a dialectic between the sensuous drive and the formal drive. This work's last section advocates a "dynamic state of rights of man," which leads to the "realm of the beautiful," in which man appears to man, "only... as an object of free play."

Question: In one work, this man uses tailor swatches to explain his idea of "exemplification," in which objects both represents a predicate and also possess it. That same work claims that paintings are "syntactically unlimited and semantically dense" because of the multiplicity of meaning in both the marks on the paper and what they could possibly refer to. This philosopher renounced the concept of abstract entities with Quine in "Steps Toward a Constructive Nominalism" and formulated a "calculus of simplicity" in his essay "On the Theory of Systems," the first chapter of his The Structure of Appearance. Another of his works opens an essay on "The Problem of Counterfactual Conditionals," and develops the theory of projection. In that work, he argued that the choice of predicate bases could not be explained by Hume's method of basing induction in repetition, and that coming up with rules equivalent to laws of deductive logic for induction was the "new riddle of induction."

Question: This practice had an analog in the cult of Cybele's practice of taurobolium, and this practice is advocated by the Right Ginza in Mandeism, which follows this action with a sacred meal. A reference to this practice "for the dead," is contained in 1 Corinthians 15:29, in which it is asked "if there is no resurrection, what will those do," to whom this has happened. That practice may originate in the rituals of the Orphic cult, which carried out this action to prepare their dead for the underworld. According to the Arians and the Donatists, this action was only efficacious if performed by someone who was of pure intention and belonged to the church, while leaders like Conrad Grebel and Felix Mantz argued that only an adult could undergo this ritual and denied its usefulness to infants. This practice is generally considered the first sacrament in Catholicism. Taking its name from the Greek for "to immerse," for ten points, identify this action which was performed for Jesus by John, and which involves annointment with water, symbolizing entry to the faith.

Question: This author's feud with Rufus Griswold led Griswold to write a vituperative biography about him. He was known as the "tomahawk man" because of his devastating critical reviews in magazines such as Godey's Lady's Book. This author claimed that poems which preached morality committed the "heresy of the didactic," and argued that short stories and poems should be short enough to be read in one sitting in order to produce a "single effect" on the reader. He satirized the Transcendentalists as "Frogpondians," and sparked a controversy by accusing Henry Wadsworth Longfellow of plagiarism in 1845. This author called the death of a beautiful woman "the most poetical topic in the world" in an essay outlining his systematic planning of one of his poems, which repeats a single-word refrain to create a melancholy tone. He outlined his literary ideas in essays such as "The Poetic Principle" and "The Philosophy of Composition." For 10 points, name this author of "The City in the Sea" and "The Raven."

This thinker noted that scriptural literalism requires as much conjecture as the work of David Strauss in his appeal to supplant the cultural identity of Christ in favor of a "New Being." His best known work identifies meaninglessness as the culprit behind the present "age of anxiety" and closes by observing that the title concept is rooted "in the God who appears when God has disappeared." This author of The Dynamics of Faith more centrally described a question-and-answer relationship to explain how divine revelation serves as an inextricable counterpart to ontology in his three-volume Systematic Theology.

Question: Derek Pereboom has developed a so-called "Four-Case" argument against this philosophical position. Peter Strawson argued for this philosophical doctrine on the basis of resentment by analyzing the psychological impossibility of abandoning reactive attitudes. John Martin Fischer advocates a "semi-" version of this philosophical position by denying the "principle of transfer of blamelessness" in fail-safe situations, while Harry Frankfurt argued for this philosophical position in a 1969 paper by denying the Principle of Alternative possibilities. Daniel Dennet argued for this position by positing the possibility of constructing a deterministic deliberator in his book Elbow Room, and in general arguments for this position affirm the possibility of assigning moral responsibility despite the fact that every event is causally determined by previous events.

Question: In the 1980s, Jeffrey Alexander relaxed this perspective's traditional assumptions to develop a "neo" version of it. Gabriel Almond adapted this perspective to political science in order to compare different political systems. An influential version of this perspective analyzed systems using five pairs of "pattern variables" such as "diffuseness and specificity" and "ascription and achievement." An essay by Kingsley Davis and Wilbur Moore used this perspective to propose a positive model of social stratification. This perspective dominated American sociology from the 1930s to the 1970s in part because it was supported by the theories of Robert Merton and Talcott Parsons.

Question: One method for solving this problem relies on Chothia's finiteness hypothesis, and the CASP studies are conducted to evaluate different methods of solving this problem. In one approach to this problem, the frozen approximation is employed to simplify pairwise comparisons. In another, each position in the target is assigned to one of eighteen environmental classes based on criteria such as degree of exposure; both of these approaches are types of threading. Many programs used for this application, such as Rosetta, use rotamer libraries to simplify conformation sampling.

Question: One story about this figure relates how he supposedly obtained the Perfection of Wisdom texts from the king of the nagas in exchange for teaching the king his philosophy. A central concept in this thinker's philosophy is the notion of pratitya-samutpada, or "interdependence," which characterizes conventional reality, and he advocated mahakaruna, or "great compassion," as a means of transcending samsara. According to this thinker, the true cause of suffering was ignorance, which could be overcome through the realization of the anatman, or "no-self," and he argued that in order to have svabhava, or "essence," a thing must have a non-relational identify. Since nirvana is conceived of in opposition to samsara, this thinker argued that nirvana was not utimately real, and neither is anything else, and advocated that ignorance be counteracted through meditations on sunyata, or emptiness.

Question: The theory of these objects was informally introduced through by Ruth Barcan Marcus in her 1961 article "Modalities in Intensional Language." David Kaplan presented a theory of these philosophical ideas in a lecture later published as "Dthat" shortly after they were formally introduced in a lecture series by their best-known popularizer. One of the uses of these philosophical concepts is to demonstrate the existence of necessary a posteriori propositions and contingent a priori propositions, and the inventor of this term proposed that proper names and natural kinds such as water are examples of these. Originally proposed in their best-known form in the lectures that became Naming and Necessity through the example of Hesperus and Phosphorus being the same object, for ten points, identify these philosophical concepts whose name was coined by Saul Kripke which refers to a description that has the same reference in every possible world.

Question: Zhang showed that curvature and indeterminacy are independent in the type of this object named for King, Plosser, and Rebelo, but not in the Bennett-Farmer variety under endogenous time preference. The isoelastic type of this object is a special case of HARA that assumes Brownian motion in continuous time. Rabin incorporated fairness into this object, which is often restricted to be quasiconcave. An axiomatic theory of these objects assumes rationality by requiring completeness, independence, transitivity and continuity, and is named for Morgenstern and Von Neumann. An early one of these resolved the St. Petersburg Paradox and is named for Bernoulli, who suggested it was logarithmic.

Question: The "analytic" approach to studying this concept was advocated in a work entitled Ends of the breastplate. The literature associated with this concept usually takes the form of monograph codes, commentaries, and responsa, the latter of which is an attempt to interpret this concept in relation to current problems and includes such works as a book called The Lion's Roar. The "enactments" written as a result of applying this concept are called taqqanot, while decrees issued pursuant to this concept are called gezerot. The development of this concept was initiated by the "splendid ones," or ge'onim, who were supplanted by ri'shonim such as Shelomoh Yitzhaki, or Rashi. Modern codification of this concept was undertaken by Yosef Karo with the publication of the Shulchan arukh, while the major geonic codification of it is the Mishneh Torah of Maimonides.

Question: One chapter of this work claims that without some "insignificant ornament" such as a "haunch button," a suit of clothes is in want of something. That chapter cites the customs of cranial deformation among Native Americans and foot-binding among the Chinese to define the influence of "custom" and "fashion" on the subject of this work. The author of this work argues that it would be wrong for men to not treat women with "pleasantry, and attention" in a discussion of sex as one of the "passions which take their origins from the body," as opposed to the social, unsocial, and selfish passions. The second of this work's six parts discusses "merit and demerit," whereas the opening portion describes human judgment with respect to adversity and propriety. Extensively discussing the "sympathy" that has men rejoice in the joys of others and feel sorrow at others' sorrows, this work elucidates the "nature" and "motive" of morality, splitting from its author's mentor at the University of Glasgow, Francis Hutcheson.

Question: Coleridge's Biographia Literaria most prominently plagiarizes the work of this philosopher, who resigned from the University of Berlin after losing a law suit against a man who had stolen his lectures and published them before he could present them. He wrote of God who gains freedom by becoming conscious through reflecting on ideas in himself in his book The Ages of the World. Though he edited the "Critical Journal of Philosophy" and was the college roommate of Hegel, The Phenomenology of Mind strongly condemned this man's conception of the Absolute. In his most famous work, this philosopher advanced the work of his former teacher Hegel by uniting it with the act of artistic creation as a way of advancing from chaos and inertia into order.

Question: One method of generating one of these constructs is to use Thompson's Construction to create an intermediate structure, then construct the power set of those states. Every "intrinsic," or "minimal" one of these structures has an associated syntactic monoid, and these constructs are classified as either Moore or Mealy types depending on what sort of function gives their output. The Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm generates one of these constructs, which it uses to perform a string search. A set of symbols that brings one of these to an accepting state is said to belong to its language, and it is impossible to construct one of these objects, which does not accept a regular language as a consequence of the Pumping Lemma. These objects are formally defined by specifying a finite alphabet, a set of states, and a transition function between those states. For 10 points, name this theoretical construct, often used to model simple aspects of computing.

Because of this misattribution, C.S. Peirce attributes the project of grammatica speculativa or "pure grammar" to this philosopher, and Heidegger's habilitation dissertation is mistakenly titled after this philosopher's theory of categories and meaning. It turns out that he didn't write De modis significandi by Thomas of Erfurt, but he did introduce the concept of a non-qualitative property responsible for individuation, a haecceity. He argued against the notion that certainty depends upon an uncreated exemplar, the divine illumination of Henry of Ghent, and he wrote commentaries on Porphyry's Isagoge and Aristotle's Categories.

Question: An article titled after this objective argues for it by inventing the word "teavy" and posing the question "is this table teavy?." That article defends this position by claiming that "the expression of attitude" is best achieved by art and poetry, but not by confusing the domain of science with artistic expression - an error which Nietzsche avoids. The author argues that this is necessary by stating that there are two kinds of pseudo-statements - ones which contain a word erroneously believed to have meaning, and ones where constituent words are meaningful but put together in a "counter-syntactical way." Another book's first chapter is titled after this - that chapter considers the similar phrases "Martyrs suffer" and "Martyrs exist," and contrasts them with the phrases "dogs are faithful" and "unicorns are fictitious." The aforementioned article by Rudolf Carnap argues for this "Through Logical Analysis of Language", while the verification principle is used to argue for this in the first chapter of Language, Truth, and Logic.

Question: This work argues that in a primitive language, "one word utterances" such as "bull or thunder" could be "a warning, information, a prediction" and so forth. This work points out that the sentence "Notice is hereby given that trespassers will be executed" hinges on the word "hereby" which "serves to indicate that the utterance (in writing) ...the instrument affecting the act of warning [and] authorizing." This work rejects the view that a "truth-value" of true or false is necessary to the mission of a sentence, instead focusing on a set of sentences which are not used to describe, and affect some sort of action or change upon their being spoke, called "performative utterances."

The fifth chapter of this work contrasts "single-track" and "multi-tracked" concepts to explain its author's theory of dispositions. This work introduces one important concept by positing a visitor to Oxford who sees the buildings but asks "where is the university?"

Question: The notable introduction to this work's Second Edition creates a jumbled mess by asserting the difference between "sentences," "statements," and "propositions," while Brains Trust host and notorious fare-dodger C.E.M. Joad accused it of facilitating fascism. This work ends with a chapter entitled "Solutions of Outstanding Philosophical Disputes", which is mildly ironic, as it sparked a long-running philosophical debate that saw its author publish Foundations of Empirical Knowledge and defend his sense-data theory against the attacks found in Sense and Sensibilia by John Austen.

Question: This work posited a distinction between "the satisfying and the satisfactory" and discusses Bergson's comparison of the Parthenon's frieze with the models it depicts to assert that the Greeks privileged the climactic moment of change. In "The Play of Ideas" it asserts the limitations of an aesthetic stance by providing the example of a visitor to a foreign country who cannot understand why beautifully designed articles are used for instrumental purposes, thus degrading their inherent nature. It ends with a chapter titled "The Copernican Revolution," which explores how the scientific method has resolved the opposition between theory and practice. Subtitled, "A Study of the Relation Between Knowledge and Action," it was based on its author's 1929 Gifford Lectures and argues for a pragmatic approach to philosophy's titular search for truth.

He championed the concept of the sensus literalis rather than the doctrine of the four senses championed by the Scholastics. His lectures to visiting Hungarians on Sundays and Feast days were the origin of his namesake "Homilies." He opposed the ideas of Karlstadt and argued for a spiritual sense of duty or righteous conscience. He helped edit The Letters of Obscure Men, a satire against his granduncle Johann Reuchlin's ecclesiastical enemies.

Question: An article by Tyler Burge about the "content" of these philosophical concepts outlines the modality-dominated strategy and the cognition-dominated strategy for applying Frege's Principle to these concepts. An essay which opens with the example of Ctesias hunting unicorns was written by W.V.O. Quine about quantifiers and these philosophical concepts. A paper critical of these concepts refers to them as "the systematic core of folk psychology," and argues that an eliminative materialist approach will allow us to transcend a system that employs these concepts. That paper was written by Paul Churchland, while Daniel Dennett has defended the use of these concepts by advocating that people take what he calls "the intentional stance."

He suggested that this "violence" is enacted by those who have received prestige or "symbolic capital" from entrenched societal institutions. He adapted Mauss's concept of "body technique" to describe the set of dispositions accumulated through upbringing and education. He eschewed Marx's classes to coin a term for social arenas in which agents compete for economic and cultural resources.

Question: He claimed that "conceptual truths may or may not be necessary truths" in a paper which attempted to answer questions posed at the end of Naming and Necessity, "Psychophysical Nexus"; and mused on President Clinton's impeachment, the Sokal hoax, and Richard Rorty in Concealment and Exposure. An early work of his revives Kantian notions of ethics in arguing for a rational type of the titular behavior, and the title of another of his books, which talks about "dual aspect theory" and refers to a "strain of idealism" in contemporary philosophy, refers to the attempt to find a truly objective conception of reality. His most notable work cites Davidson's anomalous monism, and chooses its central figure due to having a "sensory apparatus" strikingly different than man so as to illustrate the centrality of the "subjective character of experience" to the mind-body problem.

Question: Dekker's algorithm was the first to successfully apply these constructs, and Peterson's algorithm, which implements a bounded waiting scheme, also makes use of these constructs and was generalized to n greater than 2 my Hofri. These constructs usually support two operations denoted V and P, which correspond to an increment and a decrement operation, and the blocked-queue implementation of these constructs keeps track of the next action to be invoked through a first-in-first-out mechanism. Usually used to solve common classes of problems like the producer-consumer problem, incorrect use of these constructs can lead to either starvation or a condition in which no processes are making progress, deadlock. Invented by Edsger Dijkstra as a solution to the "dining philosophers" problem, for ten points, identify these programming constructs which control access to shared resources between processes.

Question: In his Autobiography, this philosopher priviliged Plato, Tacitus, Francis Bacon, and Grotius above all other thinkers, and he modeled his own efforts after Grotius, whose work led him to conduct the research that led to the writing of a treatise which pondered the question of whether justice is natural or conventional. This thinker juxtaposed the arts of "criticism" and "topics" in the first of his major anti-Cartesian works, On the Study Methods of Our Time, and later added to his work Universal Right a volume entitled De constantia jurisprudentis, this first chapter of which would lend its title to this man's most famous work. More famously, this man is famous for a work which reformulated the verum factum principle he himself had proposed in his On the Most Ancient Wisdom of the Italians and advanced the notion of three universal principles, those of religion, marriage, and burial.

In another work he creates an alternative conceptual schema to that of the "Platonists" he rejects, while also suggesting that philosophy can be used to create oneself. That work sees him first introduce the terminology of Ironism . This man distinguised what he thought were two different sides of the left, the critical and the progressive left, in a recent work entitled Achieving Our Country. In Objectivity, Relativism, and Truth he defended Rawls and his reflective equilibrium as an appropriate way of making political decisions in liberal democracies.

Question: One prominent school of Buddhist philosophy describes this concept as the way in which clarity is achieved. One philosopher divided this into subjective, objective, and absolute, which can include the ideology of a state. John Smart and Ullin Place developed the type-identity of this concept. That theory was criticized by Putnam and Fodor, who developed the functionalist theory of this. Experiences that are unique to this concept independently from signals are known as qualia, which are not experienced by zombies. Nicolas Malebranche's occasionalism deals with the way phenomena are placed in this concept by God, and the evil demon hypothesis, due to Descartes, posits a situation in which only this exists.

Question: In his massive three volume work Philosophy, he devotes a volume to three different modes of being: orientation, existence, and metaphysical transcendence, the last of which cannot be gained via positive or empirical methods but only through an engagement with the "ciphers of transcendence." He was critical of Bultmann's hermeneutical method of scriptural de-mythologization arguing that it unfairly introduced a "false rationalism" in religion, instead arguing for a "philosophical faith," in such works as Philosophical Faith in Face of Christian Revelation. He outlines a typology of mental attitudes based on a fundamental division which he called the Subjekt-Objeckt-Spaltung, in his work The Psychology of World Views. One work offers that for the Holocaust that while there exists collective liability there ought not to exist collective guilt in The Question of German Guilt. He ascribes to the period from 800-200BCE as the time that the initial development of the basic categories of human self-understanding, in China, India and West occurred in his work The Origin and Goal of History.

Question: One part of this work states that the fact that the word "bachelor" has less than ten letters proves that the word "bachelor" cannot always be replaced with "unmarried man." Later, it asks whether a statement "taken in isolation from its fellows, can admit of confirmation or infirmation at all." Previously, this work expresses an inability to evaluate the statement "everything green is extended" and says that "a precise artificial languge with explicit semantical rules" would not solve the problem. The author of this paper noted that many of its ideas were first expressed by Morton White in an essay about "an untenable dualism" from a book about John Dewey. Claiming that "abandoning" the title entities will lead to "a blurring of the supposed boundary between speculative metaphysics and natural science" as well as more pragmatism, this essay begins by reviewing a distinction made by Kant.

Question: This work states that "stupidity is the same the world over," and argues that if its principles are adopted, the brain trust of humanity could be doubled. In its first chapter, the author asserts that all laws begin by converting "a mere physical fact into a legal right," and argues that it is unnecessary to pass laws to prevent the central group from doing what it cannot. Its second chapter states that giving people "almost unlimited power" encourages them to abuse it, while its third chapter argues that there is no evidence that the title group is mentally inferior. The author finds no difference between St. Paul's statements "Slaves, obey your masters" and "? Wives, obey your husbands," and equates the marriage contract to "legal bondage."

Question: The architect Leah Beeferman proposed a utopian archipelago which takes advantage of this freedom. In United States v. Causby, the Supreme Court ruled that an ancient law governing this right "has no place in the modern world." Five fundamental freedoms of this were outlined in the 1946 Bermuda Agreement, and numerous countries tried to claim this right in the Bogotá Declaration of 1976. A Latin saying that begins "Cujus est solum" once provided the basis for individuals to claim this right.

Question: Kyle Herkenhoff proposed that the increasing availability of this concept partly explains the rise of unemployment duration since the late 1970s, and the contemporaneous skewing of the wealth distribution, since the unemployed can forego unsuitable job offers. Mian and Sufi's research shows that zip codes in which house prices dropped the most during the financial crisis exhibited the largest drop in demand for non-tradeable services thanks to the buildup of this quantity, which titles their book. The most productive agents are also the least patient ones in Kiyotaki and Moore's endogenous business cycle model, which imposes a collateral requirement to limit this quantity. In that model, a negative shock to the market value of collateral provokes insolvency, which brings about a Fisherian deflation driven by this quantity. The accumulation of this quantity is the driving force in Hyman Minsky's financial instability hypothesis. For 10 points, what is this quantity, which goes up the more spending exceeds income?

Question: A "balanced path" of a certain quantity in this formalism is achieved with assumptions that ensure its predictions correspond to Nicholas Kaldor's stylized facts. When this formalism's central equation satisfies Euler's homogeneity theorem, there is no need to specify the ownership of firms since their profit in the long run is zero. Mankiw, Romer, and Weil proposed augmenting this formalism with a distinction between human and physical capital. An extension of this formalism that adds the assumptions of Walrasian equilibrium and endogenous household savings is named for Ramsey, Cass, and Koopmans. Equilibrium in this formalism is achieved when gross investment equals depreciation. This formalism was intended to critique the Harrod-Domar model and uses a neoclassical production function with exogenous savings.

The West African language of Fula is unique in that diminutives are formed by this process. The Slavic language Sorbian is an unusual example since it features syncretism, in which this process is partially reversed. Unlike a related process, this process is not iterative and usually induces less allomorphy. The inherent type of this process does not depend on syntax and is contrasted with the contextual type. A type of this process that makes use of non-cognate words is suppletion and is exemplified by the Latin word fero. This process does not generate a new lexeme, unlike derivation.

Question: At one point, this book cites a left-wing journalist who asks himself "must the just cause of a people include its deceptions and errors?" after he realizes that his fate involves supporting the Koran and the Arab League. The author presents Nero as a typical model of the usurper, who came to hate Britannicus more as he was hurting him, and not content having taken his throne, ravished his love for Junia. This nonfiction work takes themes from its author's earlier autobiographical novel narrated by Alexandre Mordekhai Benillouche, which was entitled The Pillar of Salt. This book's republishing in 1991 added a new introduction by Nadine Gordimer alongside its original intro by Jean-Paul Sartre. In its preface, the author writes that the second half of this book reflects his own perspective as a poor Jewish boy growing up in Tunisia.

Question: This two-word concept titles a book which closes with the chapter "You're Fucking Around With Us? - Not For Long!"; that work predicts that poetic vandalism will bring about its revolution and was written by Raoul Vaneigem. Another book named for this two-word concept argues that a man standing on top of the Twin Towers is unable to understand this concept unless he becomes a flaneur and treats the city below as a text that he is both reading and writing. A tome named for this two- word concept discusses a "sociology of the dustbin" and criticizes capitalism for creating the vicious circle of work's boredom necessitating leisure, which is itself necessary since identities can't be established through work. In that three volume work, this concept is comprised of a triad of "subway, work, sleep" for suburban commuters that gives rise to a false consciousness. For 10 points, Michel de Certeau discussed "The Practice of" what concept, which is the subject of a massive "Critique" by Henri Lefebvre?

Question: A version of this procedure named for Tim Bartik multiplies ex-ante geographically disaggregated sectoral employment shares with aggregate sectoral employment changes to estimate labor demand shifts by geography over time. An attempt to use this technique failed because cities don't actually hire more police officers during election years. Since children born on different dates in the year are required to attend school for different lengths of time, another example of this technique used calendar date of birth to avoid selection bias in estimating the return to schooling. A prominent critique of this procedure is that it favors "cute," counter-intuitive results over addressing important questions that must be answered rigorously. For 10 points, name this identification strategy that pins down causality by using an exogenous covariate of a regressor to estimate the relationship between it and the outcome of interest.

Question: Claire Jean Kim proposed a "triangle" named for this concept which argues that a certain group of people have "relative valorization" over others. In an essay about "the aporias of a modern concept," Etienne Balibar argued that anthropology is in a state of "decomposition" since philosophy and sociology are more suited to investigate this concept. A book about this concept argues that those negatively affected by it are subject to neither exploitation nor oppression, but rather, the "nihilistic threat," which is the loss of hope and meaning. In The Mind of Primitive Man, Franz Boas concluded that this concept has no impact on cultural development or intelligence.

Question: The anthropologist W.J. McGee distinguished between the "piratical" and "amicable" forms of this process in his work on the Seri Indians. With Melville Herskovits and Ralph Linton, Robert Redfield issued a memorandum for the study of this process in 1936. As part of a study at UCLA in 1978, John Schumann created a model by this name to describe second language acquisition. Canadian psychologist John Berry created perhaps the best-known model ofthis process, which places people into four boxes - that model built on the work of Theodore Graves, who coined the term for the "psychological" type of this process. This term itself was first used in 1880 by John Wesley Powell in his report to the U.S. Bureau of American Ethnography. Under Berry's model, it is strongest when people are fully assimilated, having weak ties with their home group. For 10 point, give this term, which is the process by which people adapt to a new culture.

Question: Personal and vocational anxieties give rise to the "pseudo-" form of this phenomenon according to a model of Lionel Ovesey. Charles Socarides proposed the conflict model of this trait, suggesting that it arises from a drive that has undergone excessive transformation. The Rorschach, TAT and MAPS exams were given to thirty people with this quality by Evelyn Hooker, who found no linkage between it and intelligence. Irving Beiber conducted a 1962 study of 106 men with this condition, which he noted manifested as personality defects. In a 1935 letter, Sigmund Freud inferred a woman's son had this condition, even though she never explicitly stated it. This condition was removed as a mental disorder from the Diagnostic Statistical Manual in 1986. For 10 points, name this tendency that is indicated by a high value on the Kinsey scale, which was considered a psychosexual illness for much of the early twentieth century.

Question: This idea was used by Per Krusell and Anthony Smith to critique Thomas Piketty's "second law of capitalism." John Campbell and Gregory Mankiw estimated that about fifty percent of consumers display the behavior predicted by idea. Robert Hall showed that for quadratic utility, if one assumes that this statement is true, then consumption must follow a random walk. This statement was first proposed to explain Simon Kuznets' data showing no change in the savings rate since 1899 even as the savings rates across earnings percentiles differed. This idea is usually paired with Franco Modigliani's life-cycle hypothesis, and it was developed as a critique of John Maynard Keynes' concept of a consumption function. For 10 points, name this hypothesis which states that individuals smooth their consumption so that it is a constant fraction of lifetime earnings, which was proposed by Milton Friedman.

Question: The 1959 case of Beacon Theatresv. Westover held that claims of this nature must be decided only after a jury has resolved all other claims presented in an action. A book about the principles of this area of law by Lord Kames cites the maxim that it "acts in personam" and not "in rem." When a creditor has the right to have his lien satisfied from a particular piece of property without having possession of that property, his lien is referred to by this adjective. The doctrine of laches and the doctrine of unclean hands are these types of defenses, which deny relief to a plaintiff that has acted in bad faith. In contract law, these remedies include rescission, reformation, and specific performance. This area of law is said to "regard as done that which ought to be done," and it affords relief such as an injunction rather than a judgment for money damages. For 10 points, name this power held by certain courts to avoid the strict confines of the law, in order to achieve a fair result.

Question: In the Ramsay-Cass-Koopmans model, this activity does not increase at a constant rate, like it does in the Solow-Swan model. Building on the work of John von Neumann and Maurice Allais, Edmund Phelps defined the amount of this activity that maximizes the growth in consumption as the "Golden Rule." This phenomenon happens more in earlier stages of Albert Ando and Franco Modigliani's life-cycle model, and its opposite, prefixed with a "dis-," happens more in later stages. Ben Bernanke stated that the deficit during the Great Recession was funded by a "glut" of this activity in countries other than the United States. The marginal (*) propensity to perform this activity is equal to 1 minus the MPC. In order to guarantee "smoothing," individuals perform the "precautionary" type of this activity during periods of uncertainty.

Question: The textbook Principles of Behavior presents a formula in which the strength of this phenomenon is multiplied by V, K, and SHR to yield the excitatory potential. The strength of this phenomenon increases exponentially over time according to the "goal-gradient hypothesis." Cottrell disputed that the mere presence of others caused the increase of this phenomenon in an experiment in which cockroaches traveled to the light at the end of a maze faster when there were other cockroaches nearby, conducted by Robert Zajonc.

Question: Late in life, this man was involved in a controversy over his promotion of eugenics in his 1987 work Beyondism, which was supposed to derive a new science to replace religion. This psychologist classified data relating to an individual into L-data, Q-data, and T-data, which corresponds to data obtained from life, questionnaires, and objective tests. He developed a visual technique for deciding how many components to retain in factor analysis, involving plotting eigenvalues versus their components, a strategy called the scree test. This psychologist's work in trait assessment led him to develop a test which sought to classify individuals along its title number of scales, which include warmth, emotional stability, and social boldness. This man separated reasoning capacity from ability gained from experience in his paradigm of ‚fluid and crystallized intelligence. This student of Spearman distinguished between fl‚uid and crystallized intelligence, in the course of developing a non-verbal method of assessing intelligence to eliminate cultural bias. For 10 points, identify this British-American psychologist who devised the Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire and the Culture Fair Intelligence Test.

Question: The standard classication reference for the "narrow" type of this language group was created by Malcolm Guthrie, who subdivided it into 15 zones based on shared features and geography. The Nen language is the only known language in this linguistic group which does not follow subject-verb-object syntax, instead using subject-object-verb, and languages in this linguistic group have agglutinative verbs that carry more information than any otherword class. A mixed language that combines languages from this linguistic group with a less-popular language with Germanic origins is called "fl‚aaitaal." This language family was first systematically described by the Capuchin friar Giacinto Brusciotto, who studied its Kikongo language. According to a massive comparison-based hypothesis originally proposed by Joseph Greenberg, this linguistic group displaced the Khoisan as it radiated from the region of southeastern Nigeria and Cameroon and migrated south and east.

Question: According to Daniel Katz, these entities have four functions which he refers to as ego-expressive, ego-defensive, adaptive, and providing-knowledge. The way in which these entities form and the process by which they change was described by Richard Petty and John Cacioppo, in the Elaboration Likelihood Model. That model suggests that stable examples of these things are formed by the central route, whereas impermanent ones result from the peripheral route of elaboration. Richard LaPiere drove across the country with a Chinese couple visiting hotels and restaurants in order to observe how the actions of people contrasted with these constructs. The ABC model of them holds that they contain aff€ective, behavioral, and cognitive components, and they can be changed by the process of persuasion.

Question: Jonathan Culler wrote an article about this practice that compared it with the "nose-to-the-ground" and "savoring" models proposed by Barthes. An alternative to this method was proposed in the book Graphs, Maps, Trees, which argued for using quantitative methods from social sciences to diagram historical literary patterns. Gustave Lanson pioneered the French approach to this method, and Paul de Man explained his first encounter with it in a class by Reuben Brower in his essay "The Return to Philology." Franco Moretti proposed an alternative, "distant" version of this practice, which originated in a seminar at Cambridge where students were given anonymous poems without any information about the author or context. That seminar became the basis for I. A. Richards's book Practical Criticism, which pioneered this technique that was championed by New Criticism.

Question: Early in his career, this economist worked at Carnegie Mellon with Leonard Rapping to create a model which attempted to explain the so-called "money illusion" in labor supply. He used Edmund Phelps' island parable in his paper on the "Neutrality of Money" to model the relationship between money supply and changes in output in a simplified economy. In the title of another paper, he asked "Why Doesn't Capital Flow from Rich to Poor Countries?," a question that's known as his paradox or puzzle. He showed that the predicted relation in the Phillips Curve cannot be used to forecast the eff€ect of new monetary policies, because macroeconomic models do not adjust to the changing behavior of agents which accompany changes in economic policy. That result is his namesake "Critique" of macroeconomics. For 10 points, name this member of the Chicago School who extended John Muth's hypothesis of rational expectations.

Question: The Heston model generalizes an earlier model by allowing this quantity to become stochastic rather than constant. Arbitrage on this quantity is implemented via strategies that use a delta-neutral portfolio consisting of an option and its underlying asset. The leverage eff€ect manifests as an inverse correlation between asset returns and this quantity. In one model, the instantaneous return is given as this quantity times the di€fferential of a Brownian variable, plus driˆft times di€fferential time; that model exhibits geometric Brownian motion. The sensitivity of an instrument's price to this parameter is denoted by the letter nu and is called "vega". In equity markets, this quantity is minimized "at the money." Hence, graphs of this quantity versus strike price form a "smile." Financial beta is also called the "correlated relative" type of this quantity.

Question: Slavoj Zizek, in The Ticklish Subject, argues that there are always at least two forms of this figure, the second being an "anal" form who embodies obscene jouissance. One theorist's conception of this figure as the "third term" emerges from the exclusion of this figure from the primary dyadic relationship in Melanie Klein's object relations theory. The "ego-ideal" is an introjection of and identification with this figure. The "symbolic" version of this figure signifies the forces of law and prohibition in a concept by (*) Jacques Lacan that puns on the similarity of the French words for "no" and for "name." Religious guilt is said to come from and the totem meal is said to be symbolic of the devouring of the "primal" figure of this type in Totem and Taboo, whose surrogate then becomes the concept of God.

Question: Harrison and Kreps proposed a model of this economic concept as arising from heterogeneous beliefs of optimists and pessimists. One factual implication of their model is that this concept is accompanied by high trading volume, and this concept persists in that model because pessimists face a short-selling constraint. Peter Diamond showed that in a dynamically inefficient overlapping generations context, money or government debt can function as this concept in a way that restores efficiency. Most models of this concept are attempts to formalize a five-stage description of it proposed by (*) Hyman Minsky. Eugene Fama said "I don't even know what [this concept] is" and referred to it as a "nefarious term," while Robert Shiller defined this as a "fad" in his Nobel Prize acceptance speech. For 10 points, give this economic concept that occurs when an asset price is driven higher than its "fundamental value," and which "pops" when it is reversed.

Question: This man posited that the title social institution developed through "Consanguine," "Punaluan," and "Pairing" stages that marked the increasing centrality of inherited property and the consequent importance of preserving the legitimate male bloodline. That work by this author drew on Lewis Morgan's Ancient Society in its argument that primitive societies were matrilineal. This man also observed an increase in the child mortality rate in (*) Carlisle following the introduction of factory labor there, which he said had driven down wages and working conditions more generally by subjecting the title group to the direct supervision of factory owners.

Question: In the title essay of one collection, this thinker posited that the art and literary world reverses the rules of the economic world by making lack of economic success the marker of prestige. He argued that the social origins of the researcher, the researcher's position within his field, and the tendency to view the world as spectacle are the three main biases inhibiting us from achieving "reflexive sociology." This author originated the idea that the prestige associated with certain styles of dress, speech, etc. translate into non-financial social assets. This author of The (*) Field of Cultural Production argued that relations between social positions deposit within individuals to create dispositions towards particular perceptions and actions. Those are his concepts of "cultural capital" and the "habitus." For 10 points, name this French sociologist who argued that the concept of "taste" reinforces the social class system in Distinction.

Question: This thinker used the example of the white sap of the mudyi tree simultaneously representing milk and the mother-child bond to illustrate the polysemy of symbols, whose meaning he divided into operational, positional and exegetical levels. This man posited that in addition to the "indicative mood" of society's normative framework, there are also "subjunctive" regions of cultural experience that exist outside that framework. His work was inspired by the field work on the Ndembu tribe of Zambia he conducted together with his wife Edith. This thinker, who posited the concept of (*) "anti-structure," borrowed a term from Arnold van Gennep to describe the state of ambiguity produced when operating within the transitional threshold between the separation and reincorporation states of a ritual.

Question: Mike Dowman created a Bayesian model for how these words are acquired and develop historically. "Nol" and "wor" are this type of words in Berinmo, which Debi Roberson and others claimed provides evidence for linguistic relativism. Based on experiments with English speaking Americans and Indonesian Dani speakers, Eleanor Rosch concluded that the differences in these words did not lead to differences in how people remember the things themselves, which supported earlier studies by Eric Lenneberg and Roger Brown. Brent Berlin and Paul Kay divided these words into (*) seven stages and claimed any language that had one of the words in a given stage also had those in all previous stages. A famous sentence analyzed by Noam Chomsky concerns green ideas that lack this property. For 10 points, name this type of word, like "red."

Question: An essay on this concept criticizes Floyd Hunter's survey that asked residents of a Southern city which leaders out of a list of forty they would choose to make community decisions. That essay proposes a metric of this concept as the difference of two conditional probabilities and uses it to rank U.S. senators. That essay was written by Robert Dahl. John French and Bertram Raven posited there were five sources or "bases" of this, which include the ability to reward and expertise. Lloyd Shapley and Martin Shublik showed this property for a coalition was not proportional to the coalition's relative size, but instead proposed an index based on the number of times the coalition was (*) pivotal in affecting a vote. Dahl's study of New Haven led him to conclude that this concept was divided among several distinct groups. For 10 points, what is this concept that Weber defined roughly as the ability to make other people do what you want and which is held by an "elite" according to a C. Wright Mills title.

Question: In the introduction to one book, this man defended his reasoning a posteriori by comparing social science to what astronomers do. He argued that the inability of producers to continue maintaining a quasi-monopolistic status would lead to a breakdown of capitalism in the essay "Structural Crisis," which appears in a recent collection he coauthored with four other people, Does Capitalism Have a Future? In the first of a four volume series, this former head of the Fernand Braudel Center describes how increasing epidemics and climate change led to the failure of feudal society and forced Europeans to embrace an expanding capitalism. This man criticized modernization theorists for focusing on (*) nation-states as units of society, arguing we should rather examine the international division of labor between a wealthy core and a periphery with raw commodities and cheap labor.

Question: David Riesman claimed these places became more professionalized and more narrowly focused on self-perpetuation in a book co-authored with Christopher Jencks. A 1963 lecture about them said the "modern" type described by Abraham Flexner had been replaced by institutions that were actually several communities with differing goals. In a recent book, William Bowen argued the inability to substitute capital for labor in these institutions implies stagnant productivity and hence increasing cost per unit, an example of what he and William Baumol called "cost disease." (*) Clark Kerr delivered the Godkin Lectures on "the uses" of these institutions, and Bowen's book argues MOOCs would allow them to remain affordable.

Question: Faye Crosby's study of Boston women found a discrepancy between people's belief about this activity in their personal lives and at a national level, the "personal/group discrepancy." A 1972 paper by Dennis Aigner and Glenn Cain builds on work by Kenneth Arrow and Edmund Phelps to create a statistical model of this activity, which treats it as a signal extraction problem. Gary Becker's dissertation used a (*) taste-based model of it that predicted a competitive market would make this activity unprofitable. In a 1954 book, Gordon Allport claimed it was a result of thinking categorically and placed a society where it occurred at the third highest level on his prejudice scale. Bertrand and Mullainathan documented this activity by sending fake resumes that were identical except for the name and comparing the callback rates, and "Gentlemen's Agreements" are typically employed to engage in this. For 10 points, name this activity that refers to disparate treatment on the basis of race, religion, or gender.

Question: The prologue of a book by this author describes how, in the wake of Sputnik, newspapers expressed the hope of humanity finally escaping from Earth. Because the upheaval of modernity has made any reliance on customs impossible, this author advocated Kant's notion of reflective judgment that relies on no fixed rules and that is necessary for moral political action. This author distinguished between work, which is artificial and expresses human freedom, and (*) labor, which is bestial and not free. Those two activities are ranked below action, which as an end in itself is equivalent with freedom, and all three are parts of the vita activa. In another book she describes a man who is "neither perverted nor sadistic" but "terribly and terrifyingly normal" at his war crimes trial.

Question: David Roediger argued contradictions between republican ideals and the material condition of this group led to the emergence of "white people" as a distinct concept in The Wages of Whiteness. Gareth Stedman Jones attacked as anachronistic a work about this group, which was also criticized for its depiction of Methodism as a "chiliasm of despair" that distracted these people from their thwarted political aims. That work's preface states the author wishes to save this group "from the enormous condescension of posterity," arguing its members weren't passively shaped by structure but (*) "present at its own making." The second half of The Road to Wigan Pier is largely a meditation on why this group has not espoused socialism, and E.P. Thompson wrote about the English type of this group.

This man argued operations such as combining probabilities or segregating different options occurred during the editing phase of decision-making, which is followed by the evaluation phase. This man and an alphabetically-latter collaborator wrote a paper that proved the substitution axiom rarely holds because people give disproportionate weight to (*) certainty.

Question: A 2005 book by Robert Bruegmann defends the egalitarian nature of these places. Bennett Berger wrote an article on "the myth" of them based on his studies in California, arguing the purpose of such a myth was a more general cultural criticism. Kenneth Jackson examined what made the American version distinct from the rest of the world in Crabgrass Frontier. Based on his study of one of these places in New Jersey, Herbert Gans argued the stereotype of (*) "homogeneity" was better described as "compatibility," and that the hyperactive sociability described by people like William Whyte was greatly exaggerated. Lewis Mumford hated theses places and complained that people who lived here conformed "in every outward and inward respect to a common mold."

Question: A 1985 paper by George Akerlof and Janet Yellen shows that second-order deviations from this property can have first-order effects on welfare. Economy and Society describes two types of social action with this property, one instrumental and one value-focused. Formally, a preference relation has this property if it is transitive and complete, and the Allais Paradox pertains to the absence of this property in experimental settings. A seminal 1961 paper argues that expectations of price movements are predictions under the relevant economic theory, and hence those expectations possess this property. Subsequent models that employ this approach to expectation formation were popularized by (*) Robert Lucas and imply a vertical Phillips Curve. Weber defined a society of legal authority as one where these kinds of rules predominates, and he compared this property to an iron cage. For 10 points, name this assumption about individuals' behavior made by most economic models.

Question: A 1971 paper by Peter Diamond showed that there's no reason for this activity to exist in the general equilibrium of a model of costly search, contrary to Stigler. Phillip Nelson argued the cost of this activity serves as a signaling mechanism, explaining why it is more commonly used for experience goods than search goods. Another theory of this activity argues that it serves as a complementary good through "prestige effects;" that approach was developed by Becker and Murphy. The (*) "Torches of Freedom" campaign was an attempt by Edward Bernays to apply Freudian theories to this activity.

One kind of these occurs when tensions are resolved in a "flashpoint," according to a model of them created by Walter Dean Burnham. Angus Campbell began an ongoing research project studying these at the University of Michigan. Paul Lazarsfeld presented his model of communication flowing from mass media to opinion leaders in a book studying events surrounding one of them. (*) V.O. Key proposed an especially important type of these events in an article focusing on these events in New England in the 1920s.

Question: One impetus for the adoption of this policy was the prosecution of Morris Schappes for perjury before the Rapp-Coudert Committee. A notable violation of this policy occurred in 1968 in the Ocean Hill-Brownsville Community Control District, in which most of the victims were Jewish and the necessary funding was provided by a pilot project of the Ford Foundation. Charles Kendall Adams effectively bestowed this on Richard Ely, the founder of the American Economic Association and a supporter of labor unions, in a report that defends (*) "sifting and winnowing" in pursuit of truth. A 2008 contract that would have abandoned this policy in exchange for steeply graded salaries up to $130,000 to be provided by the Gates Foundation was rejected in a defeat for Michelle Rhee, then the Washington DC schools chancellor.

Question: The inequality in these constructs for mothers who enroll kids in childcare is one example of them discussed in Unanticipated Gains by Mario Small. They explain persistent income variation by geography in the former West Germany following reunification in a paper by K.B. Burchardi and T.A. Hassan. Thomas Chaney added a second "geography" dimension to a family of models of these constructs in which they grow in a two-stage process that begins with a uniform draw over previous generations. The derivation of conditions under which the degree distribution of these constructs is scale-free is the subject of research by Matt Jackson. These constructs, which have been used to analyze physics citations and racial dating patterns in high school, were studied in an experiment in which people in Omaha or Wichita received envelopes bound for Boston.

Question: One book by this writer, which discusses the contemplation of one's own skeleton, was criticized for a lack of direct contact with the Yakut, Buryat, and other practitioners of the title "archaic techniques of ecstasy." He wrote another book that begins by discussing Rudolf Otto's treatment of the "numinous." This student of Joachim Wach noted that the name for three Sumerian cities, Dur-an-ki, denotes a direct line. He discussed the ubiquity of "world pillars" in his book on the "Symbolism of the 'Centre,'" which also discusses the axis mundi. This thinker often imagined a homo religiosus to illustrate "irruption" events that he calls hierophanies. He said that modern man's confrontation with linear time causes the "terror of history," which produces a longing for cyclization and reconnection to the divine; he summarizes that idea with a term borrowed from Nietzsche, "eternal return."

Question: Iowa State professor Gary Wells, perhaps the world's leading expert on these people, identified the "dud- alternative effect" and proposed using sequential rather than all-at-once techniques to improve the effectiveness of these people. After conducting a series of experiments involving a number of black dots on a white sheet of paper, Hugo Munsterberg published a groundbreaking 1908 book arguing that these people are vulnerable to "illusions." John Yuille helped demonstrate that these people fall victim to the weapon-focus effect. Mood congruency and the cross-race effect also explain why these people make mistakes. If "unnecessarily suggestive circumstances" are not present, the due process clause does not require a preliminary judicial inquiry about this type of person, according to the 2011 case Perry v.

One book by this thinker, a picture collection of hundreds of aesthetically pleasing male youths, caused a ruckus by featuring Bjorn Andresen on its cover. Another book by this author, which argues that the poems supposedly addressed to the Fair Youth are actually addressed to Ann Hathaway, states that its goal is to fill the "wife-shaped void" in Shakespeare's biography. This author of Beautiful Boy and Shakespeare's Wife wrote another book suggesting that "if you think you are emancipated, then you might consider the idea of tasting your own menstrual blood" in its section "The Wicked Womb." That book by this author asserts that "women have very little idea of how much men hate them" and that the nuclear family stifles a woman's ability to be free, turning her into the title figure.

Question: For a construct of this type with only two outcomes, the formula "bp minus q, all over b" gives the Kelly criterion. Ambiguity aversion, which was first demonstrated in an experiment asking participants to value these constructs, is illustrated by the ones central to Daniel Ellsburg's paradox. The study of that paradox and Allais's paradox, which also centers on a set of constructs of this type, led to the development of the "rank-dependent" or "anticipated" theory of John Quiggin. Daniel Bernoulli developed expected utility theory to resolve the question of why a construct of this type with an infinite expected value is nonetheless worth very little, the so-called St. Petersburg paradox. Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman illustrated prospect theory with contrasting constructs of this type in which participants become risk-seeking or risk- averse depending on the certainty or possibility effects. For 10 points, name these constructs that can be set up to turn a guaranteed profit if there is a "Dutch book" set of odds.

Question: Marlaine Smith applied this concept to the study of nursing, placing it two steps below the "particulate- deterministic," "interactive-integrative," and "unitary-transformative" paradigms in a metaparadigm chart. This theory was applied to archaeology in Nunamiut Ethnoarchaeology by Lewis Binford, who used it to construct methods by which the waste of Paleolithic societies could be used to determine hunter-gatherer behavior. An essay explicating the original form of this concept gives as examples "Gilbert on magnetism, Boyle on atmospheric pressure, or Darwin on the formation of coral atolls." This concept was developed as a counter to Talcott Parsons, and suggests that small-scale, ideologically interchangeable ideas that generate multiple "testable hypotheses" are needed to bridge a gap between "grand theories" and empirical observation.

Question: Giovanni Sartori's book on these institutions characterizes them "as part" and "as whole." In a book about the "why" of these institutions, John Aldrich argued that they are highly endogenous. According to the Lipset-Rokkan hypothesis, these institutions have been divided by four cleavages that emerged in the 1920s. Richard Katz and Peter Mair have claimed that, since the 1970s, the "cartel" type of these institutions has arisen. Markku Laakso and Rein Taagepera proposed using the inverse Simpson's index to calculate the effective number of these institutions, which name a book that distinguishes their "elite- based" and "mass-based" types. They also name the book in which Robert Michels stated his "iron law of oligarchy." According to Duverger's Law, plurality rule and proportional representation tend to favor systems with two of them.

Question: In one work, this thinker argued that our genes, the culture in which we were born, and the self's impact on the mind are the three "veils of Maya" that separate our illusions from true reality. In another book, he outlined ten pairs of antithetical traits, such as naïvety and wisdom or energy and quiescence, that characterize creativeness. This author, who proposed a "psychology for the third millennium" in his book The Evolving Self, wrote a book about "the psychology of discovery and invention" called Creativity. The ideas of this thinker were implemented by a team led by Kelee Santiago and Jenova Chen, who designed a video game in which a multi-segmented translucent organism devours other organisms with dynamic difficulty adjustment. That video game illustrates this man's concept of a state of optimal experiences that is achieved when skill level and challenge level are neither too low nor too high.

Question: This book, which quotes W.R. Greg's description of a "careless, squalid, unaspiring Irishman," observes that Thomas Woolner's sculpture of Puck has pointy ears. It is written in two volumes, one of which refutes the Duke of Argyll, and the other of which describes a war between a selfish, anarchic tribe and a courageous, disciplined tribe to show that "praise and blame," rational reciprocity, or group selection might justify acts of self-sacrifice. This book's author uses the death rates in France to illustrate that single men are less healthy than married men, an intended chapter of which was spun off into The Expression of the Emotions. It explains that certain "secondary characters" like musical talent and odor glands are ornaments that are useful because of male competition and female choice.

Question: In Happy City, Charles Montgomery recounted a visit to Disneyland with the economist Paul Zak where he conducted a variation of this experiment that always ended in success. Bushman and Bonacci conducted an electronic variant of this experiment involving scholarships given to people of either European of Arabic descent. One variant of this experiment was used to predict whether LBJ would defeat Barry Goldwater. This experiment was more successful in neighborhoods with higher social but not necessarily economic capital, and it was first tested in New Haven, Connecticut. This experiment was less successful when it involved organizations like Friends of the Nazi Party.

Question: This effect caused participants to more negatively react to a foreigner who criticized their home country in a study by MacDorman and Ishiguro. Christian Keysers used the contrast between leaf spot and leprosy to argue for the threat-avoidance underpinnings of this effect. Steckenfinger and Ghazanfar used "coo", "scream" and "neutral" faces to replicate this effect in macaque monkeys. The original paper on this topic contrasted the difference between shinwakan and bukimi and plotted the affinity of a prosthetic hand and a Bunraku puppet; that paper was written by Masahiro Mori and borrowed from a Freud essay on Hoffmann. This effect is blamed for the poor reception of the films The Polar Express and Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within. For 10 points, give this term for the eeriness felt in viewing a human-like robot.

Question: Chris Knight argued that this practice became linked with hunters eating their own kills instead of sharing them in a book subtitled "Menstruation and the Origins of Culture." Joseph Shepher wrote a book taking a "biosocial view" of this practice, whose "second type" was analyzed by Francoise Heritier. George Murdock's book Social Structures presents a list of 250 societies where this practice does not occur. Malinowski theorized that this practice leads to fundamentally disruptive rivalries, in contrast to Levi-Strauss, who argued that restrictions on it led to the origin of human culture and caused expanding group alliances through exogamy. Studies of the kibbutz system support the idea of a "natural aversion" to this practice caused by the Westermarck effect, which prevents it from occurring between people who grow up together. For 10 points, name this type of sexual behavior which many societies hold taboo.

Question: One section of this book discusses a class of students who claim that Americans resemble the culture of the Kwakiutl instead of the Pueblo. Its eighth chapter distinguishes between the political styles of indifferents, moralizers, and inside-dopesters. This book includes a section analyzing the shift from "the invisible hand to the glad hand," and ends with chapters describing obstacles to personal autonomy at work and at play, such as the tyranny of the peer group. It begins by linking patterns of population growth to social traits, and argues that societies with declining birth rates produce individuals who seek validation rather than esteem and are metaphorically equipped with radar instead of gyroscopes. Written along with Reuel Denney and Nathan Glazer, it analyzes the transition from "inner-directed" to "other-directed" character types. For 10 points, name this analysis of postwar American life written by David Riesman.

Question: In a study of a major Mexican reform to this policy, Hastings, Hortacsu, and Syverson explained high fees using a model of advertising to build brand loyalty and price insensitivity. Auerbach and Kotlikoff proposed a principle for measuring the allocation of the tax burden across time under this policy, their "Generational Accounting." One argument in favor of this policy is based on the dynamic inefficiency of an OLG economy with income growing faster than the interest rate, according to a seminal 1965 model by Peter Diamond. High administrative overhead followed a Chilean reform to this policy based on a mandated 10% defined contribution and transition costs that massively increased the government debt-to-GDP ratio. For 10 points, name this public policy typically constructed as a pay-as-you-go public pension scheme funded by a payroll tax.

Question: One thinker with this last name wrote a book which uses the steamboat that smashes Huck and Jim's raft as an example of the recurring symbol of technology breaking up an idyllic landscape in American literature. That thinker with this last name explored the tension between the Industrial Revolution and the American "pastoral ideal" in his book The Machine in the Garden. An economist with this surname explained how money transformed the formula C-M-C to M-C-M in his analysis of the circulation of commodities. That economist developed the "Immiseration Thesis," and argued that the increase in constant capital compared to variable capital causes the rate of profit to tend to fall over time. This last name is shared by American Studies pioneer Leo and an economist who divided society into an economic base and an ideological superstructure.

Question: This theory has inspired dyadic developmental psychotherapies such as Watch, Wait, and Wonder. Peter Fonagy attempted to extend this theory to include mental representations. Carol George and Mary Main developed the AAI to measure the central concept of this theory. It was originally proposed by an English psychologist dissatisfied with Object Relations Theory, who used it to explain the formation of "internal working models." An experiment testing this theory determined three styles of its namesake phenomenon: secure, insecure avoidant and insecure ambivalent. That "strange situation" experiment was created by Mary Ainsworth. This theory was proposed by John Bowlby, who was inspired by Lorenz' imprinting studies and Harlow's experiments with wire mothers. For 10 points, name this psychological theory, which argues that babies have a biological drive to seek proximity to a protective caregiver.

Question: In this book's eighth chapter, the author considers workers movements in Europe and warns of a "cheap and dangerous socialism" that results from "excess pondering." That chapter, which begins with a quote from "The Beast" by William Vaughn Moody, compares the ownership of land to Jason attaining the Golden Fleece. Its author laments the death of his infant son, only to realize that his death prevented him from growing up "choked and deformed within the Veil," in its chapter "Of the Passing of the First-Born." This book begins by discussing the unspoken question "How does it feel to be a problem?" It describes the history of the Freedmen's Bureau in its second chapter, which declares "the problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color line."

Question: Blundell et al. pioneered the sequential maximum path approach to counter the criticism of low power in statistical tests of this theory. That critique arose from the observation that data sets used to test this theory showed consistent increases in wages during the post world-war period, making it difficult to reject this theory's predictions. Afriat also proposed the "cyclical consistency" criterion equivalent to the generalized axiom of this theory. H. S. Houthakker postulated the "strong form" axiom of this theory, which suggests the existence of well-behaved indifference curves. Behavioral economists point to context effects as an argument against the normative interpretation of its namesake observations. This theory relies on observations of consumption bundles and prices to construct utility functions for agents. For 10 points, identify this theory pioneered by Paul Samuelson, which uses observed choices to infer the responses of economic agents.

He argued that contemporary Western culture's dependence on technology needs to be addressed by stressing historical education, an idea outlined in his book Technopoly. He extended this desire for historical perspective in his book Building a Bridge to the 18th Century. This man also advocated for an "open school" free of computers and set up the New Rochelle High School according to principles he discussed in Teaching as a Subversive Activity.

Question: In the final section of this work's fourth book, the author resolves what he sees as a paradox in the ancient Greeks' attitudes towards music. In resolving another paradox that this work's author attributes to Bayle, this work argues for religion as having a "restraining motive." This work argues that public debts "take the true revenue of the state from those who have activity and industry, to convey it to the indolent," because raising taxes to pay debts raises the price of labour. In a book dedicated to crime, this work alleges that in Japan, almost all crimes are punished by death because they represent disobedience to the emperor, and uses this information to demonstrate how "excessive punishments may even corrupt a despotic government." This work isolates honor, fear, and virtue as the motivating principles behind monarchic, despotic, and republican governments, and its 11th chapter argues that "there is no liberty if the judiciary power be not separated from the legislative and executive."

Question: While working for NBER, this economist created the first measure of Total Factor Productivity, publishing it in Trends in Output and Employment. This economist wrote the first article on what is now called frictional unemployment, giving rise to the subfield of search theory, which focuses on the process of hunting for bargains or for work. He argued that the minimum wage is ineffective in combating poverty because it affects different professions differently due to the variance in optimum wage for employers. In his paper "The Economics of Regulation," he argued that regulatory agencies end up inadvertently furthering special interests in a phenomenon that he called regulatory capture. His namesake law states that all demand curves are inelastic.

Question: Hurwicz and Walker proposed incentive-compatible mechanisms for achieving a form of this concept proposed by Lindhal. In an infinite time horizon, assuming that utility functions have weak separability in consumption and leisure, these should be homogenous according to the Atikinson-Stiglitz theorem. That result was extended to suggest that assuming homogenous discount rates, one form of these should be zero for infinite horizons according to the Chamley-Judd theorem. A similar result by Diamond and Mirrlees showed that for flexible economies, these should always allow maintaining output along the production possibilities frontier. Constraints on maintaining utility and profits while applying these were the earliest formulation of the Ramsey problem, giving rise to the "optimal" analysis of these entities, which can hurt those with a high marginal propensity to consume. For 10 points, name these distortions that come in lump-sum and value-added varieties, and can be levied on income.

Question: In his paper, "The Status of Content," Paul Boghossian argued that this theory, which he classified as a form of error-theoretic irrealism, was self-contradictory because it presupposes the claims about truth which it itself denies. Stephen Stich has argued in favor of this theory in a 1983 book which claims that we should reject semantic taxonomies in favor of syntactic ones. One philosopher has argued for this theory on the grounds that it is "parochial" to "assume that communicative structures are the model for cognitive structures" in the book Neurophilosophy. This theory's major proponent wrote a 1981 paper in which he used this theory to deny the existence of propositional attitudes such as intentions, and this theory generally holds that folk psychology can be completely reduced to neuroscience, thereby removing the need for mentalistic talk.

Question: This author of Fundamentals of the Linguistic Prototype died while writing a book on the Kawi language of Java. This linguist conducted an 1821 study of place names in Spain and France, concluding that the Basques once extended over a much larger area. This man's statement "languages makes infinite use of finite means" is often quoted by Noam Chomsky, and this man is seen as one of the first to argue that human language is governed by rules. This man described language as the "formative organ of thought" and considered differences between languages to be Weltansicht, or "differences of representing the world," an argument that inspired later linguists to formulate a theory based on how the Hopi viewed time. Apart from helping to inspire the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, he also wrote political theory and represented his native Prussia at the Congress of Berlin.

Question: The Groves-Ledyard mechanism aims to encourage people to reveal their demand for these entities. Depending on whether groups that provide them expand or contract, Mancur Olson divided these into inclusive and exclusive kinds. Erik Lindahl proposed a tax based on people's utility derived from these entities. The Samuelson condition states that these (*) goods are efficiently provided when the marginal rate of transformation equals the summed marginal rate of substitution for all individuals. Private markets often underprovide these goods because their demand curves are found by vertically summing individual demand curves. The free rider problem was motivated by these non-rival, non-excludable goods. For 10 points, name these goods which are typically shared by members of a community.

Question: In Colonial Desire, Robert Young demonstrates the influence of the racial theories of Ernst Renan on this book's dichotomy between the forces of Hellenism and Hebraism. This book indicts society for worshipping freedom without adequately considering the ends of freedom in its second chapter, entitled "Doing As One Likes." The first chapter takes its title from the fable of the spider and the bee from Jonathan Swift's The Battle of the Books, and it also popularized Swift's phrase "sweetness and light." This book traces the origin of the desire to see things as they are, or "scientific passion," and desire to do good, or "social passion." Its preface defines the first title concept as the "pursuit of our total perfection by means of getting to know ...the best which has been thought and said in the world."

Question: This book includes examples like a dialogue about a pinkish glowing ring and anthropologists who have to describe a god in the woods using descriptions from tribesmen about traits like eye color, though they all refer to the god as Feenoman. A recurring contrarian named Otto is used to challenge points in this work. Its first section says there is a "combinatorial expansion" of possibilities for a figure who thinks he's paralyzed lying on the sand and starts to move, making it impossible for scientists to pipe in realistic stimuli to a brain in a vat. This book argues against both "Stalinesque" and "Orwellian" theories of perceptual editing. It uses demons in Pandaemonium as an analogy for a series of interfering parallel processes in a model meant to replace the outmoded idea of the "Cartesian theater." This work claims that people can't be distinguished from "zimboes," beings which can report on their own intentional states but lack qualia.

Eliot's possible allusion to a song by John Donne when Prufrock thinks he's heard the mermaids singing. It concludes that attempting to determine whether that allusion "makes sense" through exegesis is preferred to writing a letter to Eliot to ask him about it. Later collected in the book The Verbal Icon, this essay critiques the "confusion between a poem and its origins." FTP, name this landmark essay of New Criticism, written in 1951 by William K.

Question: This practice was pioneered in Great Britain by William Price, a physician who supported the Neo-Druid movement. In Aztec tradition, this act is done after cutting locks of hair from the top of the head, and mixing them with hair that's been stored since birth. In Bali, it's done on an auspicious day during the Ngaben ceremony. Some traditions hold that it removes ashaucha, and after this action, the antim ardas is recited - in that Sikh tradition, it's done during the antim saskar. It was banned as an "evil custom of the past" by the Meiji government in 1873 for being unfilial, but it's nearly universal in modern-day Japan where, after this action, a picking ceremony with chopsticks occurs. Since the 1960s, Catholic churches have begun to contain columbaria to accommodate this practice. While this act was being performed, widows were sometimes forced to undergo sati.

Question: A framework for calculating risk capital for a firm by using the cost of its implicit guarantees to its subsidiaries was developed by Perold and this economist. The Jarrow-Turnbull model uses random interest rates to extend the framework of this man's namesake model, which uses the idea that a call option can represent a company's equity to assess its risk. The maximization of expected lifetime utility with respect to the allocation of wealth between equity and risk-free assets is known as the namesake portfolio problem of this economist. This member of the failed LTCM hedge fund may be better remembered for enhancing the option-pricing model developed by two of his colleagues.

Question: Dan Sperber and Deirdre Wilson wrote a book named after one of this thinker's constructions, claiming it subsumed the three similar constructs with which it was grouped. According to this thinker, certain attempts at communication tend to be non-conventional, calculable, non-detachable, and defeasible. This thinker described exploitation of his constructs through flouting them as a form of communication. This man defined a speaker trying to impart something to a hearer merely by having the hearer recognize his intention as non-natural meaning, or meaning-nn. His theory of implicatures espouses that people pay attention to Quality, Quantity, Relevance, and Manner in making cooperative utterances. For 10 points, name this man who did foundational work in pragmatics, including the formulation of his four maxims for conversation.

ANSWER: Herbert Paul Grice [accept Relevance before "this thinker"; I guess accept irony before "this thinker" as well since Sperber and Wilson did a lot of work on that]

Question: By using a mathematical model in which valuation varied with quality, Novos and Waldman concluded that this concept did not lead to increased social loss from underutilization, while Takeyama showed that under certain conditions the absence of this concept could produce Pareto optimal results via network effects. David Levine and Michelle Boldrin have argued against this concept in a book which claims that this concept does not produce the increasing returns claimed by its advocates. The decision in Feist v. Rural established that "sweat of the brow," was not sufficient for this status, holding that this status requires originality. Baker v. Selden held that this status was not applicable to an idea but only to the expression of an idea itself, while Gyles v. Wilcox established an abridgement of this status called "fair use." Regulated on an international scale by the 1988 Berne Convention, for ten points, identify this legal concept outlined in Article 1, section 8 of the Constitution which grants exclusive rights to authors over their works.

Question: At one point, this work posits that if all animals in Britain were to die and foreign trade ceased, the "loss of life would be something fearful to contemplate," in order to draw analogy. In reference to perpetuation of the title beings, this work suggests that "the days of flirtation, courtship, and matrimony appear to be very remote," but nevertheless cautions the addressees against "becoming more subservient." This work suggests that if we compare the lever to the Great Eastern, we will be "awestruck at the vast development," and asks in reference to that development, "In what direction is it tending? What will be its upshot?" First published in the form of a letter from "Cellarius" to the Christchurch Press, this essay conjectures that "an entirely new kingdom has sprung up," and that "mechanical life," is parasitic upon human life and thus should be destroyed.

Another section of this work lauds Adam Smith, "whose genius dimly foresaw everything and left us to do everything," and draws on Smith's designation of tax collectors as "unproductive." That chapter of this work suggests that proportional taxes are a "monstrous inequality," because they tax everyone the same number of days of pay. Chapters 3 through 7 of this work trace economic evolution from the division of labor through machinery, competition, monopoly, and the police period, and this work ends by concluding that the solution to the human enigma "is found... in these words: education, progress."

Question: In 1979, Marshall and Zimbardo replicated the experiment that provided the first evidence for this theory, but were unable to reproduce its results. This theory was supported by a 1974 experiment conducted by Dutton and Aron, which found that male subjects were more likely to call the woman interviewing them if the interview took place on a shaky suspension bridge. It was first tested in a 1962 experiment whose subjects were told they were being injected with the vitamin Suproxin, but were actually injected with adrenaline. A confederate then deliberately irritated the participants of that experiment, causing the subjects injected with adrenaline to become extremely angry, a result that supported this theory. It challenged the prevailing Cannon-Bard theory of the same phenomena, arguing that those phenomena arise from both physiological arousal and the mental label of that arousal.

Question: In a recent paper, Robert Griffiths of CMU has argued that this property is identical to the factorization condition used in deriving the CHSH theorem, and has claimed that it is always present so long as the probabilities are evaluated on the proper sample spaces. In the formalism of Ghirardi, Rimini, and Weber, the absence of this property is equivalent to the occurrence of outcome-dependence. The absence of this property is explicitly assumed in the velocity guiding equation that is central to the Bohm formalism. No theory can contain hidden variables, reproduce the statistical predictions of quantum mechanics, and possess this property as a consequence of Bell's theorem.

In another case involving this concept, the Supreme Court rejected the logic of "business necessity," and allowed the implementation of this concept on the basis of statistical evidence. That case was Griggs v. Duke Power Company, and legislation implementing this policy includes the 1972 extension of Title VII, the Equal Employment Opportunity Act. For ten points, identify this policy which took its name from Kennedy's Executive Order 10925, which was meant to ensure that "applicants are employed without regard to race," and whose constitutionality was upheld in the 1978 case of Bakke v.

Question: This thinker criticized Becker and Murphy's argument that drug addiction is rational by claiming that addictive behavior results from people losing struggles against self-control in his article "The Intimate Contest for Self-Command." This thinker modeled a traffic jam to show how aggregate behavior results from individuals not caring about the effects of their actions on others in Micromotives and Macrobehavior. He placed pennies and nickels on a board and randomly moved the ones adjacent to coins of the same color to demonstrate how minor racial preferences could still result in fully segregated neighborhoods. This thinker visualized arms races as a "competitive dialogue," and showed that two people simply told to meet somewhere in New York City would likely go to places such as Grand Central Station to explain his theory of focal points.

Question: Barbalat's lemma is useful when analyzing this property in time-varying systems. Lienard's theorem gives the conditions needed to guarantee the van der Pol oscillator possesses this property. The second method of one of this property's namesakes requires a function V of x such that V of x is greater than zero and V-dot of x is less than zero. Barkhausen names a criteria for this property in which the product of the gain and the transfer function is one, graphically illustrated in a Bode plot. Electrical engineers usually consider the BIBO form of this property in linear signals, while this property of equilibria is asymptotic if solutions converge to that equilibria, but merely Lyapunov if solutions do not escape.

Question: In one article, this economist wrote that the task ahead was to "write a FORTRAN program" that accepts economic policy rules as inputs and generates output statistics on the operating characteristics of time series. In a 1969 study with Leonard Rapping, he explained the low employment levels during the Great Depression as resulting from the elasticity of labor supply within the business cycle. In his paper "On the Mechanics of Economic Development," he introduced the idea of human capital into the production function to create an endogenous growth model with Hirofumi Uzawa. He wrote about the "neutrality of money," which is maintained with predictable inflation, in an article outlining his "islands model." The idea that normal Keynesian models cannot accurately analyze how changes in monetary policy will affect the economy is known as this man's critique, while his paradox concerns flow of capital to developing nations..

Question: This thinker wrote an essay entitled "The Overvaluation of Love" which looks at the histories of seven women and their obsessive need for a male partner. This theorist believed that people have two views of the self: the ideal self is used as a model for the real self when working toward self-actualization, but trouble arises when the real self deteriorates into the despised self. The need for a partner and the need for social recognition are two of this thinker's ten patterns of needs - which are classified as "moving towards," "moving against," or "moving away from" people. Those three coping strategies were outlined by this thinker in the book Our Inner Conflicts.

Question: In Interrogating the Real, Slavoj Zizek argues that Foucault's treatment of the sex act could be described as utilizing this process, since he analyzed sex as an "artificial unification of heterogeneous desires." In their Anti-Oedipus, Deleuze and Guattari illustrate this process with reference to Richard Lindner's painting Boy with Machine. Derrida argues that if this practice is truly the "necessity of borrowing one's concepts from the texts of a heritage...it must be said that all discourse" could be partaking of this process. The formulator of this concept presented it in a work which analyzed the marriage rituals of the Aranda and the Arabanna, two indigenous Australian groups.

Question: Though it went unpublicized for decades, this phenomenon was first observed by Irwin Katz in the 1960s. A critique of this concept by Paul Sackett et al. pointed out a lack of external validity and noted that effect sizes were often misreported in the press. Toni Schmader and others have argued that underlying mechanisms of this effect include stress arousal, vigilance, and impairment of working memory and self-regulation, while Geoff Cohen and others have shown that self-affirmation can counteract its effect. Its primary advocate, whose twin brother Shelby developed the related concept of "racial vulnerability", demonstrated this phenomenon in a famous study with Joshua Aronson, showing that black students performed less well on difficult GRE questions when they were described as a test of intelligence.

Question: This book argues that early Church fathers relied on widespread illiteracy to downplay prophecies such as "Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass" and revise Christianity to be less millenarian. The early chapters tend to summarize a figure such as Bruno Bauer and then offer criticism, but the final hundred pages of this book offer the author's own theory of "thoroughgoing eschatology," which was later expanded on in The Mystery of the Kingdom of God. Three chapters of this book are devoted to the theories of David Friedrich Strauss, whom this book's author claims wrote the perfect work of literature. It devotes chapters to the "liberal lives" of the subject as well as to potential (*) Buddhist influences, and its subtitle notes that it is a critical study of progress "from Reimarus to Wrede."

Question: It argues that much confusion originated with the idea that some supersensible property exists and ends with a chapter celebrating the importance of "personal affection" entitled "The Ideal." This work, which stressed the importance of historical context in predicting what results would follow certain types of action, dismissed Herbert Spencer's ideas by declaring that his Darwinian outlook degenerated into "hedonism." In another section it posited that an evaluative term cannot be entirely defined by the way it is applied, a demonstration known as its author's "open question argument." This work argued that previous thinkers, like J.S. Mill, committed the "naturalistic fallacy" and it posited intuition as the solution to identifying what is bad and what is good. Published in 1903, it built on the ideas of its author's mentor Henry Sidgwick, for 10 points, identify this work by G.E. Moore.

Question: One unorthodox proposed method for dealing with it involves massive foreign currency purchases. Eggertson and Woodford argue that for open-market operations to be effective in this situation requires changing future expectations of policy. Consequently, one approach for dealing with it has been written about by Lars Svenson and involves an explicit central bank commitment to a future price level, also known as nominal GDP targeting. Another method for dealing with this problem is when the Treasury agrees to broaden its asset purchases, termed "quantitative easing." Paul Krugman has written about Japan's experience in this state, and has argued that the recent economic crisis is an instance of it.

The Supreme Court declined to extend this case to contractual abdication of one's right to free speech in United Egg Producers v. Standard Brands, and an Ohio court notably refused to apply this case to the probation of a will in Shapira v. Union National Bank, in which the decedent conditioned his sons' inheritance on their marrying Jewish women.

Question: The reading of this section of a larger work was the basis for Jacques Derrida's 1985 book Prejudice, and its author is the subject of a chapter entitled "Canonical Patience and Indestructibility," in Harold Bloom's The Western Canon . Walter Benjamin claimed that this part of a larger work appears at such a significant moment that it looks as though the novel in which it is contained is only the unfolding of this story. This fragment of a larger work is followed by an interpretive monologue that considers such aspects as the "impersonal questions," and the "Tatar beard," of one individual in this story, and the man who tells it later remarks that "the man sits down on the stool... and waits there for the rest of his life... of his own free will." This story, which is contained in a chapter entitled "In the Cathedral," concerns a man who seeks admission to something that he thinks "should be accessible to every man and at all times," but is denied entrance by a door-keeper, who, upon the man's death, shuts the door.

Question: Simon LeVay showed that this trait is linked to a smaller third interstitial nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus. A bogus 2004 study by Klar used the rigorous method of sitting on a beach creepily leering at the backs of people's heads to claim that this trait was correlated with a counterclockwise hair whorl. The intensity of this trait increases with higher values on a scale examining its past, present, and future contexts; that scale is the Klein Grid. Freud's Letter to an American Mother is centrally concerned with this attribute, which was the subject of an early textbook by Havelock Ellis. This trait is classified as a 6 on the Kinsey Scale, and was removed as a disorder by the APA in 1973. For 10 points, identify this trait that denotes sexual attraction to members of the same sex.

Question: This thinker suggested that beliefs should be evaluated according to the four criteria of: volume, intensity, rigidity, and content. This thinker defined one of his most important concepts as: "any way of acting [] capable of exerting over the individual an external constraint". He argued that an increase in population per area and degree of social interaction produces greater "dynamic density", which precipitates a move from mechanical to organic forms of solidarity. He created the concepts of the "social fact" and the "collective consciousness". This author of The Rules of Sociological Method wrote a work that contrasts egoistic, altruistic, fatalistic, and anomic motivations for taking one's own life.

Question: A 2000 study by Duka et. al. found that getting people hammered makes them less susceptible to this process if they were already intoxicated to begin with. Ernest Renan's "What is a Nation" pairs this process with "historical error" as essential for national creation. Endel Tulving theorized that this process was caused by a lack of cues, which Godden and Baddeley tested with divers. This process can be modeled by the equation "R equals e to the power of negative t over S," and its magnitude was studied using a series of nonsense syllables. This process occurs when unrehearsed traces fade away according to Henrich Ebbinghaus, who developed a "curve" for it and suggested it could be mitigated by mnemonic devices.

Question: A modification of this model can be plotted on a phase space diagram, on which a saddle path goes through two of the quadrants formed by the c-dot and k-dot equals zero loci. Because agents discount future consumption in that variant, the saddle path does not intersect the capital-maximizing "golden rule" proposed by this model. This model predicts capital maintains a constant share of output, matching one of Kaldor's "stylized facts." Romer added human capital to the micro-inspired Cobb-Douglass production function at the center of this model. This model added labor to the earlier Harrod-Dommar model. It assumes investment in new capital is a constant fraction of output. For 10 points, identify this neoclassical growth model developed independently by its namesake and Trevor Swan.

Question: In Proto-Indo-European studies, this kind of ablaut contrasts with both the "e-grade" and "o-grade" varieties. In English syntax, this form of complementizer is inherent to the sentence "I think they like me." This type of "derivation" is exemplified by using a noun such as "pen" as a verb, as in "I penned it." In the Chomsky hierarchy, unrestricted grammars are also called "Type-[this]". Arabic and Hebrew use this type of copula in sentences lacking a word for "to be." In linguistics, this term also denotes an inferred word or part of speech that isn't outwardly expressed.

Question: In the Marshall-Lerner condition, the sum of two applications of this quantity to exports and imports must exceed one. The Singer-Prebsich thesis argues that the value of this measurement when applied to manufactured goods suggests that commodity-rich nations will become increasingly impoverished. Values for this concept can be found by taking a linear regression when both variables are expressed in natural logarithms. If the demand function is known, Lerner's Mark-up Rule applies this concept to solve for the optimal price of a good. Veblen and Giffen goods have a positive value for the price version of this.

Question: Constructing this form in Finnish involves using the auxiliary verb "olla" and the participle endings, and in Welsh it is created by adding the letters "as" before another form. Italian uses both "recent" and "remote" versions of this verb form, and in French, it is formed in writing by adding a past participle to forms of "avoir" and "etre." German and French speakers both use an alternative version of this form in which particles from another tense are doubled. In Latin, this verb form is created in the subjunctive by adding "isse" before the personal verb endings, and in the indicative by adding "era" before the personal endings. For 10 points, identify this verb form, a tense or aspect which indicates an action that was completed before another action of the past referenced in the surrounding context, or chronologically before the perfect.

Question: Gibson's paradox is the fact that while the gold standard was in force, this value was positively correlated with the wholesale price level rather than inflation. The Mundell-Fleming model shows that the global version raises the local version. It is the dependent variable for the LM curve in the IS/LM model, as greater output increases the demand for money and causes this value to increase to keep it in equilibrium with supply. The Fisher equation shows the nominal version of this to be approximately equal to the real type plus the rate of inflation. For 10 points, name this cost of borrowing money.

Question: Green proposed that this phenomenon occurs via his activation and inhibition model. A landmark study by Peal and Lambert examined the relation between this phenomenon and intelligence. The idea of multi-competence was developed to analyze people's measure of it. Its acquisition can be delayed by cross-meaning due to a type of "transfer." The distinction between the sequential and simultaneous forms of this ability depends on the time of acquisition of "L sub 2." People who possess this ability may be able to perform code-switching and may facilitate lexical borrowing. Communities marked by this phenomenon may exhibit diglossia or use a lingua franca.

Question: Meese and Rogoff published an article that finds random walk models of these quantities are as accurate as empirical models of them, such as the sticky-price one. Fisher's open hypothesis suggests that changes in nominal interest rates correlate to changes in these quantities. Rudi Dornbusch developed the overshooting model to explain the volatility of these quantities when the money supply increases or decreases. The theory of purchasing power parity seeks to normalize these quantities by following the law of one price. Undervaluation leads to an increase of these quantities, which bolsters economic growth. The Bretton Woods Conference set them by using the dollar as the standard of reference. For 10 points, name these quantities that relate the values of different currencies.

Question: For two-good Cobb-Douglas utility functions with decreasing returns to scale, this function is linearly proportional to utility. Shephard's Lemma gives this microeconomic function for a good as the partial derivative of the expenditure function with respect to the price of the good. A key equation of consumer theory gives the result that the change in this function for a good with respect to its price is dictated by only (*) substitution effects, not income effects; for this reason, this function is generally referred to as the compensated form of its variety, and hence can only have a negative slope. That equation dealing with this quantity is the Slutsky equation. This function for a good can be calculated by solving the dual optimization problem to utility maximization which involves minimizing cost under a utility constraint.

This is a feature of Diamond and Dybvig's model of bank runs since patient depositors may or may not withdraw their deposits in period one. So Morris and Shin offer a modification in which depositors observe the period two return with noise, in which case the equilibrium is in cutoff strategies. Thomas Schelling's notion of the 'focal point' is a means to predict which outcome of games with this property will be observed. Schelling's famous example is that "noon at Grand Central" would be chosen by any two individuals looking to meet in New York City. For 10 points, what is this feature, in which there is more than one outcome of a game in which each player's strategy is optimal given the strategies of the other players?

Question: Unlike Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, Kripke-Platek set theory does not have the axiom of infinity or the one named for this object, although it is still possible to prove the existence of Cartesian products in Kripke-Platek set theory, which is usually done in Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory by using the axiom which constructs this object. In automata theory, constructing an equivalent deterministic finite automaton from a given nondeterministic finite automaton with set of states Q involves performing this operation on Q and using the result as the new set of states for the deterministic finite automaton. Cantor's diagonalization argument can be generalized to show that the cardinality of this object is strictly greater than the cardinality of the object it is constructed from. For a finite set with n elements, this object has 2 to the n elements. For 10 points, name this set of all subsets of a given set.

Question: In Drautzburg and Uhlig's model of this, the length of time that the Zero Lower Bound is binding is a critical determinant of the effectiveness of this tool, and those authors conclude that the multiplier associated with this is less than one. Barro argued that this tool can never be effective since a government that sells its debt to its own citizens, to be repaid by taxing them or their children, cannot add to the overall wealth in the economy. That argument is ostensibly drawn from David Ricardo, though he himself doubted its empirical validity. This tool was most famously advocated by Keynes as a means to smooth fluctuations in aggregate demand. For ten points, what is this field of economic policy related to government spending and taxation, the debate over which was reinvigorated by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act?

Question: In tonal languages, these constituents in phrase-final positions frequently become privileged contour tone licensers due to their length. The weight categorization and rhyming domains of these constituents has prompted Donca Steriade's argument for their conceptual replacement by "vowel-to-vowel intervals", though the current explanations for glottalization and aspiration in English rely on these constituents as the basic phonological structure. These constituents are optionally constructed with codas and onsets, though they are theoretically always centered on a nucleus, or sonority peak, which may be a nasal, liquid, approximant, or another component.
